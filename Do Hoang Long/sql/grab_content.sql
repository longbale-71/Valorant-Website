Tôi là Sammi Pedregon, Quản Lý Nguồn Lực Họa Sĩ Thuê Ngoài của VALORANT. Hôm nay, chúng ta sẽ cùng bàn luận về nguồn cảm hứng và quá trình hoàn thành skin Nunca Olvidados.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Không chỉ đề cập đến việc lên ý tưởng cho skin trong bài viết này, tôi còn muốn chia sẻ về hành trình Nunca Olvidados đã mang tôi - một người Mỹ gốc Mexico thế hệ thứ 2 - đến gần hơn với nguồn cội của mình. Ông bà tôi là người Mexico. Từ khi còn nhỏ cho tới tận khi tôi lớn lên, ông bà chưa khi nào lảng tránh hay sợ hãi cái chết, bởi họ thấy cái chết sở hữu một vẻ đẹp thiêng liêng mà tới giờ tôi vẫn chưa hiểu được.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Vì lẽ đó mà đây chính là nguồn cảm hứng dồi dào cho skin Nunca Olvidados và quá trình sáng tạo skin đã giúp tôi hiểu rõ hơn về gốc gác của ông bà mình. Không một ai tránh khỏi cái chết, và người đã ra đi sẽ không thể trở về. Bởi vậy, chúng ta nên hồi tưởng và tiếp tục trân quý những kỷ niệm với họ. Quá trình thực hiện skin này đã giúp tôi nhận ra được những ý nghĩa lớn lao.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>TRUYỀN THỐNG</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Nunca Olvidados là một cụm từ trong tiếng Mexico-Tây Ban Nha có nghĩa là \"không bao giờ bị lãng quên\", được lấy cảm hứng từ ngày lễ Día de los Muertos (Lễ Hội Người Chết) của người Mexico. Ở Mexico, cộng đồng người Mexico và trên khắp khu vực Mỹ La-tinh, lễ hội này sẽ diễn ra trong nhiều ngày từ ngày 01 – 02/11 và là dịp hồi tưởng về những người thân yêu đã qua đời, từ lúc sinh thời cho tới khi họ ra đi.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Cả gia đình sẽ quây quần và lập một bàn thờ nhỏ (ofrenda) thường được bày biện đồ ăn, thức uống và hình ảnh của người thân đã khuất. Họ tin rằng những lễ vật này sẽ giúp linh hồn người thân tìm về thăm nhà. Những viên kẹo hình đầu lâu, cách vẽ đầu lâu lên khuôn mặt và những bông hoa flor de muerto (hoa cúc) tươi tắn là những biểu tượng thường thấy trong ngày lễ này và ngày càng trở nên phố biến hơn trong những năm trở lại đây.</br>\r\n\r\n<br><img src=\"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/bltc24311a6f36cd1b7/616f3911f13b7e5c89d3eb0e/Nunca_First_Concepts.jpg\" style=\"vertical-align: text-top;\" alt=\"\" width=\"600px\" height=\"400px\"></br>\r\n\r\n<br>Tôi đã vô cùng phấn khích khi lần đâu thấy hình ảnh minh họa Nunca Olvidados của Josh Kao, nghệ sĩ ý tưởng cấp cao của công ty. Những bông hoa cúc, người phụ nữ với khuôn mặt vẽ hình hộp sọ, bộ váy có họa tiết đầu lâu phát sáng, thậm chí cả tông màu đều thật đặc biệt và thân thuộc với tôi.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Nhìn vào hình ảnh đó, tôi liên tưởng ngay đến Día de los Muertos dù trước đó không hề biết là dòng skin này đang được thực hiện.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Sau khi chứng kiến toàn bộ quá trình minh họa ý tưởng, tôi thầm mong được thực hiện skin này nhưng lại ngập ngừng không xin tham gia. Hình ảnh cuối cùng của dòng skin trông đẹp vô cùng và thể hiện đúng nét tinh tế của văn hóa Mexico trong tâm trí tôi.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Và đến khi được giao nhiệm vụ tìm đối tác bên ngoài cho dòng skin này thì niềm vui trong tôi như vỡ òa! Tôi đã vô cùng háo hức vì có cơ hội đóng góp vào một skin mang nét văn hóa gần gũi với tôi.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>QUÁ TRÌNH THIẾT KẾ - Ý TƯỞNG</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Josh Kao và Cathy Woo - nhà sản xuất liên kết phụ trách đối tác bên ngoài - đã phối hợp sát sao với văn phòng của Riot tại Mexico trong việc thiết kế và đặt tên skin/vũ khí cận chiến nhằm đảm bảo sản phẩm giữ được tính chân thực, tôn trọng truyền thống và không sáo rỗng, hời hợt. Các bên cũng cùng trao đổi và chọn ra thời điểm thích hợp nhất để ra mắt skin cho trùng với dịp lễ Día de los Muertos năm nay (20/10-02/11).</br>\r\n\r\n<br><img src=\"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/blt8d9f94a3648b2719/616f391190079752a47e82b3/Nunca_skinline_concepts.jpg\" style=\"vertical-align: text-top;\" alt=\"\" width=\"600px\" height=\"800px\"></br>\r\n\r\n<br>QUÁ TRÌNH THIẾT KẾ - KỸ THUẬT ĐỔ BÓNG</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Chúng tôi đã dự định tạo cho skin 2 kỹ thuật đổ bóng:</br>\r\n\r\n<br>1 .///Chuyển đổi giữa 2 kết cấu (ngày/đêm). Skin sẽ chuyển giữa hình ảnh ngày/đêm tương ứng với 2 vùng sáng/tối trong trò chơi. Kỹ thuật đổ bóng này đã được chúng tôi áp dụng cho dòng skin Mùa Đông Kỳ Diệu (một tràng vỗ tay nhiệt liệt cho Sean Marino!)</br>\r\n\r\n<br>2 .///Từ góc nhìn của người chơi, hình người phụ nữ và bông hoa phía sau sẽ được chiếu lên khẩu súng, thay vì được tạo hình trực tiếp trên vũ khí. Đây cũng là kỹ thuật đã được áp dụng với dòng skin Ghép Hình (xin cảm ơn Chris Stone!)</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Cách hay nhất để truyền tải ý tưởng về sự sống và cái chết của Lễ Hội Người Chết qua một dòng skin là tạo cho skin đó các đa sắc \"ánh sáng\" và \"bóng tối\" thay đổi theo vùng sáng và tối trên bản đồ.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Với việc họa tiết skin được chiếu lên mặt bên của vũ khí, hình ảnh hiện ra khi người chơi ngắm vũ khí ở góc nhìn thứ nhất sẽ khác hoàn toàn so với hình ảnh skin trong phần Bộ Sưu Tập. Chúng tôi muốn cô gái hiện lên nguyên vẹn khi người chơi cầm súng trên tay, nên đã chiếu từ góc độ máy quay để hình ảnh được đẹp và chỉn chu nhất. Hình ảnh cô gái có nét gì đó rất tao nhã và chúng tôi muốn người chơi cũng sẽ cảm nhận được điều đó.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Dự định ban đầu của chúng tôi là khẩu súng sẽ chỉ chuyển đổi qua lại giữa 2 đa sắc, giống với Mùa Đông Kỳ Diệu. Tuy nhiên, sau khi cả nhóm cùng xem xét lại, họa sĩ thiết kế vũ khí 3D của chúng tôi nói rằng anh ấy rất thích phiên bản tối của skin. Phiên bản sáng dù cũng đẹp nhưng với anh ấy, sắc tối mới là chân ái và anh ấy chỉ muốn sở hữu phiên bản đó mà thôi.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Tôi biết rất nhiều người chơi cũng cảm thấy như vậy và đó là vấn đề mà chúng tôi cần cân nhắc. Có những người chơi khi góp ý về các skin kiểu này đã nói rằng họ chỉ cần có một đa sắc, chứ không cần phiên bản chuyển đổi giữa hai dạng. Thể theo mong muốn đó, bên cạnh cơ chế chuyển đổi thông thường, người chơi cũng có thể chỉ chọn 1 trong 2 đa sắc của skin này.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Bởi các khẩu súng chuyển đổi đa sắc trước đây đều có một cấp độ, nên chúng tôi không muốn phân chia skin này thành nhiều cấp độ để mở khóa tính năng chuyển đổi ở cấp 3. Lý do là để đảm bảo sự công bằng cho những người chơi đã mua những skin chuyển đổi đa sắc trước kia.</br>\r\n\r\n<br><img src=\"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/bltd9fef7eb9b3f4ae7/616f3911385f7a513f0de0b4/Nunca_Skinline02.jpg\" style=\"vertical-align: text-top;\" alt=\"\" width=\"600px\" height=\"400px\"></br>\r\n\r\n<br>QUÁ TRÌNH THIẾT KẾ - 3D</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Quick rewind: Before the team began the concept of the skin, they established important visual pillars. Nunca Olvidados should accurately represent the holiday, but also feel festive and blossom with elegance for players who may not be too familiar with the traditions.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Tóm tắt nhanh: Trước khi bắt đầu lên ý tưởng về skin này, cả nhóm đã đặt ra những nguyên tắc định hướng quan trọng về hình ảnh. Ngoài việc tái hiện chính xác ngày lễ, Nunca Olvidados còn phải mang không khí lễ hội và hấp dẫn đối với những người chơi vẫn còn lạ lẫm với truyền thống này.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Chúng tôi tránh tạo ra những chi tiết khiến skin trông giống đồ chơi trẻ con, mang lại cảm giác đau buồn hoặc sai lệch ý nghĩa của ngày lễ. Đây không phải là một Halloween thứ 2, mà là một dịp chúc mừng riêng biệt. Ý tưởng skin đã bám sát vào các giá trị này, và tôi cần đảm bảo rằng công đoạn thiết kế 3D cũng phản ánh được điều đó.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Ngay khi nhận được sản phẩm đang hoàn thiện đầu tiên từ phía đối tác, chúng tôi đã bổ sung thêm nhiều chi tiết vào phần thiết kế của cả hai phiên bản sáng và tối. Đối với phiên bản sáng, chúng tôi đã nhấn thêm một vài điểm ánh kim để người chơi không chỉ tập trung vào họa tiết màu xanh lam.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Phần ruy băng cũng tỏa ánh sáng cam để mang lại cảm giác \"lễ hội\" hơn cho skin. Hình ảnh cô gái có vẻ quá chìm vào phần nền của súng, vì thế mà chúng tôi đã tăng độ sáng nền để giúp cô ấy nổi bật vừa đủ ở vị trí trung tâm.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Tiếp đến, với phiên bản tối, chúng tôi muốn những chi tiết phát sáng vừa đạt được độ vừa phải dễ nhìn, vừa tôn lên nét đẹp tương xứng với phiên bản sáng. Đồng thời, phiên bản tối cũng không được gợi lên cảm giác ảm đạm, phải tạo được không khi vui tươi kể cả khi dùng màu trầm.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Sau một số điều chỉnh trong kỹ thuật đổ bóng cũng như xem xét lại tác phẩm cả trong nội bộ lẫn với phía đối tác, chúng tôi đã hoàn thiện skin Nunca Olvidados.</br>\r\n\r\n<br><img src=\"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/blt71157193d11bcca5/616f3911923218529eecdd47/Nunca_Skinline01.jpg\" style=\"vertical-align: text-top;\" alt=\"\" width=\"600px\" height=\"400px\"></br>\r\n\r\n<br>Chúng tôi cho rằng skin Nunca Olvidados là một tuyệt tác. Nó phản ánh chân thực ngày lễ Día de los Muertos, đồng thời thể hiện tinh thần lễ hội vui tươi, đầy sắc màu dành cho những người chơi chưa biết đến phong tục này.\r\n\r\nDù là sự sống hay cái chết thì vẻ đẹp vẫn luôn hiện hữu và chúng tôi hy vọng skin này sẽ phản ánh được thông điệp đó.</br>\r\n\r\n<br><img src=\"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/blt4c21fd918b10fdfe/5fac1a3342256d5ffdf426f0/VALORANT_Logo_V_(author_bio).jpg\" style=\"vertical-align: text-top;\" alt=\"\">SAMMI PEDREGON \r\nNgười quản lý nguồn lực họa sĩ thuê ngoài của VALORANT.

Thế nên chúng tôi nghĩ là các bạn xứng đáng được biết rằng người đã thiết kế dòng skin Quang Phổ có thể cũng chính là người vừa mới \"khám răng\" bạn trong trận đấu vừa xong.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Đó chính là Anton Zaslavski, hay còn được gọi là Zedd. Là một người chơi VALORANT xuất sắc (bậc Bất Tử) cùng với sự hỗ trợ của đội ngũ Nội Dung Chất Lượng Cao, Zedd đã dùng niềm đam mê cùng với kỹ năng của mình trong âm nhạc và VALORANT để tạo nên Quang Phổ.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Preeti Khanolkar, Nhà Sản Xuất Cấp Cao, thậm chí đã coi Zedd như là một nhà phát triển trò chơi. Công bằng mà nói, với những thiết kế và sáng tạo về âm thanh mà Zedd đã đưa vào Quang Phổ, hẳn là anh ấy cũng xứng đáng với tên gọi đó.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>\"So với việc sản xuất âm nhạc cho bản thân, thì việc phát triển sản phẩm cho một trò chơi yêu cầu phải cân nhắc rất nhiều điều,\" Zedd chia sẻ. \"Bạn sẽ luôn muốn vượt ra khỏi giới hạn trước đó và tạo ra những thứ mới mẻ, hấp dẫn... Đây cũng là một trải nghiệm khá tuyệt với tôi khi có thể tìm hiểu thêm về công việc hoạt ảnh hay những công cụ âm thanh được sử dụng trong trò chơi.\"</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Zedd cũng chia sẻ rằng việc có skin của riêng mình trong một trò chơi bắn súng cũng giống như một giấc mơ vậy. Anh cho biết những game bắn súng chiến thuật cạnh tranh yêu thích trước đây của mình là Counter Strike Source và Overwatch giờ đã hoàn toàn bị thay thế bởi VALORANT.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Anh bắt đầu chơi từ khi VALORANT mới ở giai đoạn thử nghiệm Alpha và giờ đây đã anh đạt bậc Bất Tử. Zedd nổi tiếng với các bản phối nhạc cùng những nghệ sĩ nổi tiếng như Ariana Grande, Kehlani và nhiều nghệ sĩ khác nhưng anh ấy vẫn muốn được biết đến như một ngôi sao trong VALORANT.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>\"Tôi luôn cố gắng để trở thành MVP của trận. Tôi rất thích việc hạ mạng đầu tiên trong vòng đấu và tạo ra những cơ hội tấn công cho đồng đội. Cũng có thể nói rằng tôi thích làm cả 2 việc đó,\" Zedd nói.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Mặc dù trước một trận VALORANT, Zedd không thể dựa vào nghi thức đồ uống pha chế trước buổi trình diễn như anh vẫn thường làm nữa. Nhưng anh biết cách ổn định lại tâm lý của mình và bắt đầu mỗi vòng đấu như thể tỷ số đang là 0-0.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Nhiều người thắc mắc tại sao một người có thể vừa sản xuất và trình diễn những bài hát tuyệt đỉnh mà vừa có thể đạt được thứ hạng cao trong VALORANT, thậm chí cùng lúc có thể đồng thiết kế cho 1 dòng skin—Zedd chia sẻ rằng bí quyết của anh ấy chỉ là xây dựng một lịch trình phù hợp mà thôi.</br>\r\n\r\n<br>\"Tôi dành 1/3 khoảng thời gian đầu tiên trong ngày để tập thể thao và rèn luyện sức khỏe. Phần thứ 2 là để làm nhạc và phần còn lại tôi dành thời gian chơi game. Tôi cố gắng bám sát lịch trình đó để bản thân có thể có một cuộc sống hạnh phúc và cân bằng.\"</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Lịch trình của Zedd giống như một lời nhắc nhở chúng ta rằng cần phải có quãng nghỉ để \"sạc pin bản thân\" kể cả khi ta đang theo đuổi những điều lớn lao trong cuộc sống. Năm ngoái, anh ấy đã tạm ngưng mọi sản phẩm âm nhạc để tập trung vào podcasts. Khoảng thời gian nghỉ ngơi đó đã giúp anh ấy cảm thấy \"hào hứng muốn nghe nhạc trở lại\".</br>\r\n\r\n<br>May mắn rằng khoảng thời gian \"sạc pin\" đó đã trở thành cơ hội để VALORANT có được dòng skin Quang Phổ, và biết đâu một ngày nào đó sẽ là cả một bản remix nữa không chừng.</br>\r\n<br>\"Tôi khá bất ngờ vì những gì cuối cùng đã đạt được. Hãy cứ đặt ra những mục tiêu thật lớn cho bản thân. Rồi sau đó thực hiện theo từng bước nhỏ cũng được mà,\" Zedd chia sẻ. \"Đến cuối cùng chúng tôi đã làm được nhiều hơn những gì đã mong đợi. Đội ngũ sản xuất đã tạo ra công nghệ chưa từng xuất hiện trước đó trong trò chơi. Tóm lại là: Chẳng có gì là không thể!\"</br>\r\n\r\n      <br>HỎI ĐÁP VỚI ZEDD</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Điều gì anh cho là khó khăn hơn: chăm sóc cún con hay đạt xếp hạng Bất Tử?</br>\r\n\r\n<a>Chăm sóc cún con.</a>\r\n\r\n<br>Nghe nói anh di chuyển tâm ngắm ngược lại so với bình thường khi chơi VALORANT. Nếu điều đó là đúng, anh có thể giải thích tại sao không?</br>\r\n\r\n<br>Điều đó đúng đấy. Tôi biết là nó có vẻ hơi vô lý nhưng tôi luôn di tâm ngược lại với người khác.

Hien stops to rest every now and then, and takes that opportunity to meet up with local volunteering groups to talk about the purpose of his trip and distribute materials on environmental protection and HIV prevention.<br />\n<br />\nMoving to Hai Phong to attend university three years ago, Hien has since become an active member of different environmental clubs and his participation in these clubs has enabled him to become more aware and want to take actions for a better environment, he says.<br />\n<br />\nIn order to prepare for this special journey, Hien started his physical training since his days as a freshman at the university. Besides a daily running routine, he cycled home once a month - a distance of 60 kilometres to Hai Duong.<br />\n<br />\nFor this trip, Hien starts his day at 4.30 am doing volunteer work then begins cycling at 7 am, setting a destination goal that he tells himself to achieve before the end of each day, no matter what obstacles, including heat or rain. Everyday, Hien cycles about 120 kilometres, stopping only for lunch and rest at around 8 or 9 pm. He sleeps either at a friend’s house, a temple or a local volunteer’s place. <br />\n<br />\nWith this journey, Hien wants to send a message to young people that anything can be done with sheer determination and willpower.<br />\n<br />\nHere are some pictures of Nguyen Manh Hien during his cycling trip through Vietnam.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><img src=\"http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/haphuong/072010/10/20/traotailieu0707201020100710202113.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Hien (in white T-shirt) handing out materials to a volunteering  group in Thanh Hoa.</em><em><br />\n</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><img src=\"http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/haphuong/072010/10/20/baoverung0707201020100710202113.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Hien (middle) taking a picture with a volunteer member of the  Green Dreams Group (right) and one of the Green Youth Group in Hoa Lu,  Van Long, Ninh Binh.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/haphuong/072010/10/20/Haivan0707201020100710202114.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n<em><br />\nHien cycling on Hai Van Pass July 6. </em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><img src=\"http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/haphuong/072010/10/20/dapxecovu0707201020100710202114.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n<br />\nMembers of a volunteer group in Thanh Hoa accompany Hien (in white) for a short distance. </em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><img src=\"http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/haphuong/072010/10/20/xuyenviet0707201020100710202114.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe flag says: “Cycling through Vietnam from Hai Phong to Ca Mau”</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><img src=\"http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/haphuong/072010/10/20/giotmohoi0707201020100710202114.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><img src=\"http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/haphuong/072010/10/20/canhdong0707201020100710202114.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n<br />\nEarly morning is the only time Hien doesn’t have to wear sun protection.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/haphuong/072010/10/20/kiemtra0707201020100710202115.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><em><br />\n<br />\nThe two bags packed on the sides of his bike are full of pamphlets and CD’s.

However, the establishment’s problems with supplying power and inability to respond adequately to the needs of guests indicate that it’s got a ways to go before becoming the truly spectacular oasis it has the potential to be.</p>\r\n<p>Guests were given a range of choices in rooms; some went for the cheaper beds in rooms with only fans; others chose to pay a premium for the promise of a cool night’s sleep.</p>\r\n<p>Our arrival and welcome from the staff was pleasant, if oddly complicated by a two-step queuing and check-in procedure. Everybody was shown to their rooms, oohing and aahing over the rustic charm of the grounds and the abundant vegetation (think jack-fruits the size of small poodles growing overhead).</p>\r\n<p>The décor is a quirky blend of traditional Vietnamese textiles combined with carved wooden signs and nautical trinkets like wooden ducks and large-scale model ships. The rooms themselves range from basic (and a bit dingy) to grand, complete with old-fashioned carved wooden beds.</p>\r\n<p>After check-in most guests reconvened around the pool, beneath overhanging branches of bamboo and palm. Beer was discovered, and serious relaxation began.</p>\r\n<p>After a couple of hours splashing about or relaxing in thatched huts scattered around the lush grounds, we all migrated to the open courtyard for dinner: a parade of courses from pork skewers and squid salad to roast chicken and fried fish, and lots in between. You could tell from the hush that the delicious food was well appreciated—that is, until dusk fell and the lights cut out. The staff apologized, and after a few moments the lights were back up so we thought little of it.</p>\r\n<p>With dinner over, special guest DJs Polo, Kulture, and Cybersnack set up their equipment. Throughout the following hours, as the three DJ wizards spun their musical magic, more failures and surges in power broke the flow of the beats several times, bringing dancers to a halt and worse, threatening to damage the pricey sound equipment.</p>\r\n<p>Soon word traveled that the entire province was dealing with power outages. Still, a few guests were quick to point out that they had stayed at La Ferme with similar issues before. It seems it’s a chronic problem that the owners have failed to address adequately. Their back-up generator can’t sustain a high volume, meaning as music and large flat-screen TVs run in the central building, the rest of the houses’ power has to be cut completely. Staff assured concerned guests that once the party was over, power could be diverted back to the rooms.</p>\r\n<p>But unfortunately, even then there was scarcely enough power to run the fans, and those only for a few hours. Thereafter we were left without a trickle of electricity. A/C? Out of the question. Fans? Water for showers? Lights to find your way to the bathroom? Better luck next time.</p>\r\n<p>Come morning, those 50 some bedraggled, overheated, partied-out Hanoians crept back to the refreshing blue water of the swimming pool, downed icy beverages, and grumbled over breakfast. A sign was posted in the central room: to compensate for the inconvenience, each guest would receive a complimentary beer at lunchtime, as well as a free 30-minute massage or facial.</p>\r\n<p>I myself went for the facial, and found it took the edge off my own bad mood. After all, when you spend about 50USD extra just for the comfort of air conditioning, and end up sweating the night away in a room without even a fan to push around the stifling air, you get a bit grumpy.</p>\r\n<p>After my cucumber mask, I decided to explore the extensive grounds. My wanderings carried me over stone paths, through shady stands of giant bamboo, to an empty but quaint tea-house, and finally over a rise onto a wide, grassy hillock overlooking a large fishing pond. Each view was more stunning than the last. Coming back down the hill, I noticed a small flock of white ducks paddling around the central lotus pond. Hence the name of the resort, I finally understood, as some French I had seen on a menu once or twice came to mind.</p>\r\n<p>Completing my loop, I returned to the main house.Showers were still unavailable, so as we gathered again with our bags to wait for the bus, most of us were feeling grimy and more than ready to return to our homes.</p>\r\n<p>As for La Ferme du Colvert—well, I personally would love to return and soak up more of that verdant country charm. Nevertheless, I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a luxury experience or with an express need for electricity. The owners, who I understand live in France and are often absent, have a precious gem in their hands. But until they step up and provide the kind of management and staff training necessary to run the place well, it may be destined to remain a little-known diamond in the rough.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:50', '2010-12-26 10:23:50'),

Dish after dish was brought out and eventually the dog arrived. <br />\n<br />\nSomething about knowing it was dog made it very difficult to eat. After some hesitation, I grabbed a piece with my chop-sticks where it stayed for quite some time. I stared at the meat. I thought about it. I wondered if this is really something I could do. I thought about all the strange and interesting foods I\'d tried. From <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dtinews.vn/news/beautiful-vietnam/opinion/snake-heart-not-for-the-faint-of-heart.html\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">snake to scorpion</span></a>, I\'ve eaten many things in my time living abroad that would be very bizarre to me back home. Finally, I shook my head and said out-loud, \"There\'s no turning back now.\"<br />\n<br />\nI took the piece into my mouth and focused on chewing; trying not to think about what it was I was eating. Dog meat is very chewy and I found myself chewing longer than I anticipated, thus causing me to think. I thought too much and nearly gagged. After (a lot of) chewing, I managed to swallow the meat. Once I got it down, I started to feel a little guilty but then I began to rethink my stance which I had held quite strongly for so long.<br />\n<br />\nHad I thought it was duck, or beef, or chicken, or pork, surely I would have had no problem chewing away and scarfing it down. I wouldn\'t have thought about what I was eating, I would have simply eaten it. However, knowing it was dog made me struggle to get it down. It took concentration just to swallow.<br />\n<br />\nBefore one is quick to condemn the eating of dogs, many things should be considered. First and foremost, this is a long-standing part of Vietnamese culture.<br />\n<br />\nDon\'t assume this is something barbaric that only happens in a third-world country. South Korea, a highly-developed nation, regularly consumes dog also. In Vietnam, people don\'t grab dogs off the streets or use pets to eat. Many people keep dogs and cats as pets and not everybody in the nation consumes dog, as a matter of fact, most probably do not. In Vietnam, only one type of dog, referred to as \"cho ta\", is consumed and they are bred on a farm, or at least so I\'m told. I\'m not advocating eating dog but I certainly have no right to come into another country and tell them not to unless the animal is endangered or illegal to consume, which I am firmly opposed to. <br />\n<br />\nThe point is, before we judge the eating of any form of meat, we need to be careful of hypocrisy. Pigs are highly intelligent animals (and said to be great pets) but most meat-eaters consume pork with no problem. What\'s the difference between eating pig and eating dog when both are being bred and slaughtered for consumption? <br />\n<br />\nUltimately, it is another form of meat, raised and bred in the same fashion as the pork, chicken or beef many are so used to eating. It isn\'t any more or less humane than eating any other type of meat. Nobody is forced to eat dog and the process is no different from many of the other meats that are consumed worldwide. I\'m not sure that I\'ll ever try dog again, but I think I gave it a fair shot and have come to realize that just because something is strange, doesn\'t mean it\'s wrong. After all, this is Vietnam and we eat just about everything.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:52', '2010-12-26 10:23:52');

Popular beach destinations become too crowded, too built up, too much of a hassle. For those who like to flop around on a quiet beach and forget about the world, the most popular ‘holiday’ beaches become contradictions. Who can feel relaxed on a public holiday if you’re surrounded by thousands of screaming kids and perpetually hassled by vendors? Inevitably, you move on. You seek new horizons far from the madding crowds.<br />\n<br />\nFor now, my tip is Quang Binh province in the ‘north’ of Central Vietnam. South of Ha Tinh and bordering Laos, this is one of the country’s poorest provinces. The average annual per capita income is one of the lowest in Vietnam. But the province’s tourism industry might be the main key to boosting the local economy. The UNESCO heritage site of Phong Nha- Ke Bang cave has flown the flag so far.<br />\n<br />\nNow the province is looking to the white sandy beaches with a great deal of justifiable expectation. The bewitching sight of Nhat Le would certainly convince any developer that this is a stretch of coast worth banking on. But for now, I am also delighted to bask in the peace and tranquility that remains on offer before the bulldozers and master builders roll in. It’s a breathtaking spot and in my humblest opinion one of the country’s most beautiful beaches. Inspired by the prospect of discovering more unknown beaches, I recently decided to explore more of the coast by motorbike. And there is plenty to discover.<br />\n<br />\nIn Quang Trach district, I came across Quang Phu beach, which is popular with locals but yet to be tapped by the tourism moguls. It’s only five or 10 minutes drive from Nhat Le beach and utterly pristine. The water is refreshingly clear. As you swim around, you can see scallops beneath your feet. It’s a wonderful spot to spend a morning or afternoon lolling around in the sunshine, happily contemplating life.<br />\n<br />\nFurther along the coast, you will find Hai Ninh beach and fishing village. The views around are wonderful with imposing mountains to the west and a deep blue sea to the east. After arriving in the late afternoon, I decided to stay until sunset – yes, I’m an old romantic at heart.<br />\n<br />\nThe next morning I headed for Dong Hoi market to enjoy the bustling atmosphere. The fishermen, traders and customers convene over the catch of the day. The market might be the only hectic spot you will come across on the coastline.<br />\n<br />\nThere are already some resorts taking advantage of Quang Binh’s stunning shores and sweeping sea views. The Sun Spa Resort is leading the pack. Set on a picturesque peninsular the resort boasts 234 international standard rooms. The overall design is wonderfully harmonious and tranquil with fern-trunk thatching, private tropical gardens overlooking the ocean, private swimming pools and spacious, elegantly designed rooms.<br />\n<br />\nSun Spa Resort is the perfect gateway to discover the World Natural Heritage Site of Phong Nha – Ke Bang Reserve – though the resort is a natural wonder in its own right, set amidst a spacious 29 hectares of landscaped garden alongside the pristine white sands of Bao Ninh beach.<br />\n<br />\nFurther up the coast, there may be more to come. Development plans have been made for Da Nhay beach, another wonderful spot, 40km north of Dong Hoi. In Vietnamese ‘da nhay’ means ‘the rocks that jump’. As you might guess by that name, this is a rugged, rocky spot but there are also sandy coves for bathing on.<br />\n<br />\nYou can find more modest accommodation than the Sun Spa Resort with rooms available in family-run hotels for VND150,000 to VND200,00. Either way searching the coast for quiet spots to have a dip in the sea is a wonderful way to spend a couple of days (rather than being dragged around by a tour guide). Everywhere in Quang Binh people are hospitable, helpful and happy to share the incredible natural scenery with people from out of town. I guess they want the word to spread.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:54', '2010-12-26 10:23:54'),

It launched a lucrative contracting career.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nToday Mr. Huy has four workshops and a staff of other ex-convicts—rehabilitation through renovation—mentored by a few elder craftsmen (\"still easy to find,\" he says). He has become a local television personality pitching \"a younger generation\'s appreciation for our city\'s beautiful legacy,\" though these days he does more business creating reproductions of the old-style buildings than in fixing up the real things.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On numerous leafy side streets within sight of the Citadel—one of Vietnam\'s best-protected monuments, though still marked with bullet holes from the war with the U.S.—rusted gates and crumbling balustrades mask lesser-known architectural trademarks of this former royal capital: the handmade, nail-less one-room nha ruong and nha vuon, elegantly landscaped garden houses built for the elite of Vietnam\'s Nguyen Dynasty (1802-1945). They reflect what Nguyen Xuan Hoa, director of the biennial Hue Festival, calls \"a refined style of life that is the essence of Hue.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut there\'s not even agreement on how many remain, though all counts point to the same trend: the rapid dwindling of a once-ample heritage. When World War II broke out, there may have been as many as 20,000 nha ruong in Hue, says Nguyen Huu Thong, author of a new study of the city\'s architecture. As few as several hundred survive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost of the world remembers Hue, a city of 330,000 on the banks of the Perfume River, as site of the Vietnam War\'s fiercest battle, in which U.S. troops unleashed their firepower on the Vietcong who seized its ancient battlements during the 1968 Tet Offensive. Now the remaining symbols of peaceful, contemplative life in the country\'s cultural capital face a fresh threat: development.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nToday, a traditional Hue home is likely to turn up as a transplant in Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi, serving as a restaurant or nightclub in front of a more modern structure, or as rooftop gazebo atop one. (The first ones that Mr. Huy restored were for gift shops, though they came from the outskirts of Hue into the city.) While this does keep the historical buildings intact, Hue officials don\'t consider it an ideal solution. Where other places in Asia worry about a \"brain drain,\" they speak of a phenomenon that translates roughly as a \"house drain.\" <br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnder sloping tile roofs (the tiles now often loose), the interiors of the nha ruong are divided by rows of sturdy jackfruit-wood columns and intricately carved braces that demarcate symmetrical vestibules crammed with ancestral photos and altars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut a look inside one shows dilapidation, with bare light bulbs and linoleum replacing lanterns and terra-cotta floors. The main resident, Le Chi Nghe, is a street-food vendor who hardly has funds for restoration, hasn\'t been informed of numerous foreign preservation projects and is too suspicious of the government to apply for its loans. Besides, as is often the case, the other owners are spread around the globe, part of Vietnam\'s postwar diaspora.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"It would bring shame on us to sell this place of our ancestors, but to agree how to repair it is too big a headache,\" he says. Despite the common belief that selling is a betrayal of ancestral spirits, owners are more tempted to do so: The value of an intact nha ruong has increased 100-fold over the past decade, according to experts, and the cost of repair is likewise rising. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd for those who actually live in them, selling can be a chance to move out of homes that seem more suited to altars and offerings than air-conditioning, plumbing or privacy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"Vietnam is moving from country to city at a quicker pace than any other place on earth,\" says Paul Schuttenbelt of Urban Solutions, a Dutch nongovernmental organization advising the government\'s undermanned Hue Monuments Conservation Centre. Since Unesco declared the city\'s imperial monuments a World Heritage site in 1993, international aid has financed the clearing of some illegal buildings and care (however uneven and seemingly haphazard) for the Forbidden City and outlying royal tombs, but Mr. Schuttenbelt says much remains undone: \"Hue\'s 60 protected historic sites have yet to be centrally mapped, and the next 15-year plan for conserving the city, along with limits on demolition of heritage, has been delayed and remain unapproved.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile development here isn\'t yet the boom it is in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi or nearby Danang, Hue nonetheless shows the strains of unchecked urbanization. By some estimates, land prices have tripled in the past several years. Crowded with 100,000 people, the confines of the imperial city walls have sprouted an unsightly hodgepodge of construction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAcross the river, French colonial villas are being bulldozed and tree-cloaked streets are being widened for shopping malls and office blocks, while luxury hotels are flouting height limits recommended to maintain the royal palace\'s original sight lines.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut no element of Hue\'s heritage is more vulnerable than the scattered and unsupervised nha ruong—which Mr. Hoa, the cultural festival\'s director, declares \"no less important than the Citadel and the tombs,\" explaining that the style dates to the 16th century.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for the nha vuon, often similar but set on plots measuring up to 2,400 square yards and studded with lotus ponds, herbal plantings and decorative barriers, they \"are organs in the cultural body of Hue,\" says the head of the province\'s Department of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Phan Tien Dzung. \"They are like a small version of the royal palace for each family, and they display a model of harmony between humans and the natural environment.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVietnam\'s law dividing inheritance equally among heirs—enacted to uphold the rights of women—generally works against the interests of preservation. Some garden houses\' large lots have been subdivided into tiny areas, often leading to the construction of new concrete houses beside the nha vuon. But the divided ownership can also work to preservationists\' advantage, Mr. Schuttenbelt says: \"The lack of consensus among many relatives has also helped keep many of these houses standing.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn ambitious Ford Foundation program launched a decade ago in conjunction with Hue Heritage House, an organization founded under Unesco\'s auspices, aimed to encourage preservation by providing repair manuals and \"raising awareness of the homes\' values,\" recounts program director Michael DiGregorio. But it foundered in the face of inheritance and subdivision issues and ran out of funding with barely a single structure saved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore successful was a smaller-scale program that Hue\'s sister city of Lille, France, began the same year. It returned some 15 old Hue houses to pristine condition, walls repainted in original ocean blue, termites checked and foundations raised to cope with frequent floods. Plaques on them attest to the support of the \"Sénat du France.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn return, residents merely had to pledge to refrain from selling the homes for a profit. They weren\'t required to open them to visitors, though many do. The most often displayed is Ngoc Son, a former retreat of a princess now inhabited in messily archive-crammed fashion by Hue\'s leading historian, Phan Thuan An.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Kim Long, a green area just beyond the city walls that was the favored neighborhood of scholars and senior government officials, some of the city\'s biggest and best-preserved garden houses are readily open for view—for a \"donation\" of 50,000 dong ($2.60) to the aging residents. A quick survey reveals these were restored by owners themselves, too proud to relinquish the abodes of forebears and too wary of accepting public funds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTourism is a big part of the region\'s economy, and Hue\'s visitor numbers have slipped as those for Central Vietnam\'s other World Heritage site, the port of Hoi An—now a boutique-laden tourist zoo—have risen. With as many as 40 resorts planned along Danang\'s adjoining China Beach, Hue faces more challenges.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"World Heritage sites either adapt as living places or become tourist museums,\" says Urban Solutions head Mr. Schuttenbelt. His advice to Hue is to allow modern adaptations of its architecture while curbing overt commercialization, billboards and big hotels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for the Monuments Conservation Centre, its director, Phung Phu, has proposed expanding buffer zones meant to keep modern structures and signs from encroaching on monuments, tougher height limits and an effort to make Hue \"a model eco city.\" He vows, \"We must have new policies that meet the challenge of development.\" But no part of his next master plan has been approved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore than any NGO or government initiative, the hope for Hue\'s old houses may lie with self-appointed saviors like the youthful Mr. Huy—who says he shares \"a natural appreciation for gardens with all Hue people.\" (His mother fostered it by bringing him \"architecture books for me to study while I was in prison.\")<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"It\'s ordinary people who are showing much greater care for these houses than five years ago,\" says the crusading ex-convict, adding, \"there are not many left and we don\'t want the most precious part of our culture to vanish.\"</p>\r\n<table cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" style=\"width: 681px; height: 160px;\">\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td bgcolor=\"#cccccc\">\r\n            <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />\r\n            <strong>Trip Planner</strong><br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            Getting There<br />\r\n            There are frequent inexpensive flights of just over one hour from Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City on Vietnam Airlines.

The transparent water allows my eyes to gaze at the bottom of the sea where I can watch fish swim around colourful coral.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVisitors can stay in bungalows on the beach or with locals in a quiet village. In the future, tourists are bound to discover the gorgeous shores of this island paradise, and its unsullied beaches are likely not to stay isolated for too much longer. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince the 11th century, Quan Lan had been a centre along the commercial route. In the 12th century, Quan Lan was the first trading port of Viet Nam built under Ly dynasty. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1149, King Ly Anh Tong took this place to set up Van Don town and Van Don trading port in order to speed up commercial relationships between Viet Nam and South East Asian countries. Relics of former trading port have been discovered with traces of ancient architecture, well, and grazed terra-cotta of meters thick to prove that this place used to be a crowded urban. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the fifth and sixth lunar months, the area annually celebrates religious ceremonies to remember the area\'s former king, and residents also hold boat rowing festivals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1288, the beach was also the site of the well-known defeat of invading Mongol troops, who were destroyed by General Tran Khanh Du\'s army. Tourists in Quan Lan can visit a temple dedicated to the General, where they can learn about the history of the region and the achievements of the commander. The temple\'s roof is hidden under pine canopies. Approximately 100 steps lead to the temple\'s entrance that is halfway up a mountain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause Quan Lan is a strategically important seaport, the French built a lighthouse on its shores in the 19th century in order to protect the beach and to signal to passing merchant ships.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor tourists resting on the beach in evening, the illuminations from the lighthouse look like a twinkling star.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe dearth of post-midnight electricity makes night life a wee bit difficult to sustain in this town. During the evening hours, locals and a few tourists stroll along the village\'s main street, where sugarcane juice vendors and a few cafes stay open. The only sounds that dare to disturb the island are the melodic vibrations of karaoke bursting from living rooms and local cafes. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSa sung (kind of sea worm) is a speciality of the region. It\'s used in cooking soup, which helps provide a wonderful taste and adds nutritional sustenance to dishes. Fishing for sa sung with the locals is a popular activity for tourists.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"While men in the village go fishing in the sea, we catch sa sung and sell them to tourists and businesses on the main land as our secondary job,\" says a local woman.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are no five-star hotels at Quan Lan Beach, but tourists are able to enjoy a pristine atmosphere that has yet to be overdeveloped.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em><br />\r\n<br />\r\n</em></p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:56', '2010-12-26 10:23:56'),

I didn’t give his claim much credence at first, until I stepped foot into the market—known as Cho huyen Sin Ho, and open every Sunday.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSituated imposingly on the Sin Ho plateau of Lai Chau province, Sin Ho town is located on the highest peak, over 2,000 metres above sea level and surrounded by verdant mountain ranges and clouds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLocals call it: The Roof of Lai Chau province. The small town is also well-known as the second Sapa of the northwest area. But the climate in Sin Ho is even more sour and scornful than that of Sapa. Suddenly, you can be standing in a sea of white clouds, then, just several minutes later, the rain will rumble down like a waterfall. But right after the last rain drop falls, the sun will rise brilliantly and a cool wind will blow over the small town.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt takes me four hours to drive up the zigzagging road from Phong Tho town, at the junction between National Road No. 4D from Sapa and National Road No.12 towards Muong Lay town. The mountain road has been smoothly paved over, but it’s still a slow and winding drive. Therefore, I decide to spend a night at Sin Ho town and wait for the market until the next morning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the late afternoon, Sin Ho town looks small, deserted and gloomy, with simple and sparse wooden houses roofed with dark grey cement tiles and only a few shops and restaurants. It’s lucky that there are several modern guesthouses and mini hotels with reasonable prices. For only VND250, 000 per twin room, I check into the Thanh Binh guesthouse. It’s not an overstatement to say that at such a cost, this is the best hotel outside of Sapa in the northwestern area. It has spacious rooms, good facilities and a friendly staff.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn Sunday morning, the sleepy town comes alive. From all paths up and down leading to the town centre, waves of tribes people walk or ride horses and motorbikes, all loaded with many kinds of farm products, toward the market. These tribes come from many distant villages up and down the mountains. They are Flower Hmong, Blue Hmong, Black Hmong, Lu, Black Dao and Red Dao, among others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter a morning at the market, I take a trekking tour to Pha Xo Lin II village, just three kilometres from the town centre. The village is home to the Dao Khau tribe, also known as the Sewing Dao, or the Black Dao, who wear black trousers richly embroidered with signature flower, tree and star patterns seen on many Dao costumes. They also wear a front hanging black apron with a wide, plain blue band around its outside, together with a plain black turban.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe village is very beautiful and poetic, with dark wooden houses roofed with black stone tiles and fenced in with stone hedges. This season, the peach and mango orchards are ripening in a riot of red and yellow. It’s mouthwatering to walk in the village, where you can take a seat under the fruit trees to enjoy lovely lanterns swinging in the cool winds and their fresh and sweet tastes. Pha Xo Lin village is very famous for its special golden red mangoes, with their sweet taste and jackfruit-like flavour.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBesides its delicious fruits, Pha Xo Lin village is a shopping paradise of brocades and embroidery products. It’s common to see Dao women sitting at their thresholds in their front yards or under the fruit trees sewing passionately.

In this role, he established more than ten schools to introduce aspects of the French way of life without damaging indigenous culture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDucamp had been investigating a range of investment opportunities from Hong Kong to the French dependencies in India.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLife was good for the men and Dumoutier was already the owner of a row of houses in downtown Hanoi.</p>\r\n<p>He invited Ducamp to join in a new enterprise that both of them knew little about. After a short discussion, the two men got excited by the mere thought of it: Dumoutier provided the houses covering 3,140 square metres and Ducamp put up half a million francs in cash.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat is how the two men would come to build a first-class hotel fit for any of the world’s major cities.</p>\r\n<p><strong>A phoenix from the swamps</strong></p>\r\n<p>Towards the end of the 19th century, Hanoi, the city of lakes, grew rapidly. The French drew up detailed plans for a new town to be laid out beside the old one. Dumoutier had access to the blueprints for Hanoi, which were kept in the government’s planning division.</p>\r\n<p>At that time, Henri-Rivière Boulevard was no more than a narrow track running through marshlands and lakes. Dumotier knew that before long, it would be the new heart of the European settlement in Hanoi.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEver the opportunist, he quickly snapped up two available lots.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the capital of Indochina, Hanoi was receiving an increasing number of visitors who had to be put up in official guest houses, missions or private homes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey had the Grand Hôtel near the ‘little’ lake or the Hanoi Hôtel in rue Paul Bert and a smattering of small hostels. However, none of these were truly elegant or designed to meet the needs of the international traveler.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDumoutier was about to change this. He wanted the style of the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo with its huge ballroom and the Adelphi in Singapore.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith just 500,000 francs, the two men were able to get it up and running. On the spot where 10 years earlier a small, muddy lake had provided an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes, a huge hotel took shape.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIts façade spanned over 80 metres, making it the largest hotel in Indochina or, as the Revue Indo-Chinise remarked on March 18, 1901, “un immense hôtel”.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the summer of 1901, the Grand Hôtel Métropole Palace opened its doors to the curious population of Hanoi. A British visitor, Alfred Cunningham, who was one of the Métropole’s first guests, had written in his book, ‘The French in Tonkin and South China’, “The hotel is elegantly furnished, each bedroom has a bathroom and there is a public hall, salon de conversation, reading room. The sanitary arrangements are perfect, and the general accommodation leaves nothing to be desired.”</p>\r\n<p><strong>Limelight</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe hotel soon became the rendezvous point for colonial society in the first half of the century. During the boom years of the 1930\'s, Hotel Metropole was the social venue for all occasions, including the honeymoon venue for Charlie Chaplin after his secret wedding to Paulette Goddard in Shanghai.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing Vietnamese independence, the new government opted to maintain it as the official hotel for visiting VIP’s. During and after the war years, it became a base for press and diplomats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n90 years after it had risen so gloriously from the swamps of ancient Hanoi, the Thống Nhất (or Reunification Hotel) was closed for the face-lift of the century. As an integral part of Hanoi’s history, the hotel has played host to numerous Kings, heads of state and celebrities since its re-opening in March 1992.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>A new morning</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe hotel is divided into two wings. The historic Metropole Wing was inspired by classic French architecture with a hint of local touches. The more contemporary Opera wing, which was completed in 2007, was renovated to create a harmonious blend between the historic and modern elements of the hotel. Great care was taken to respect the rich heritage of the site while installing state-of-the-art technology.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Opera wing is ready to return to its position as a popular address for celebrities, leisure tourists, businessmen and politicians alike.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe centenary Hotel Metropole Hanoi has once again been recognized by two renowned travel publishers: Condé Nast Traveler US and Travel & Leisure, as one of the best hotels in the world.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:59', '2010-12-26 10:23:59'),

The first villagers here were all fishermen but they soon discovered that the land here was very suitable for growing vegetable. With skills and experience, farmers here have been producing some of the country’s most celebrated greens, which have been become a trademark.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA walk around the village reveals small, green, edible plants spread out in all directions, giving off a natural aromatic fragrance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTalking with the farmers here, we learn that it takes a lot of hard work to have such green fingers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“We have to learn how to till the land, sow the seeds and then how to nurture the plants,” Manh Hung, an old farmer while wiping his sweaty face, “This work may be easy for farmers in other places but extremely difficult for us here because we do not use chemical boosters and fertilizers.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is also one reason why Tra Que vegetables are being chosen by not only Hoi An’s locals, but also families and supermarkets from neighbouring areas like Danang City, Duy Xuyen and Hoa Vang Districts. They are healthier than those grown using chemicals and provide a distinctive flavor that has earned a loyal following.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Our land here is enriched by the alluvium of the De Vong River,” said Tran Minh Nhu, a local guide who has a large onion plantation. “We fertilize it with algae from a nearby lagoon. That may be the reason why our herbs are so green and tasty.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmong the more than 20 kinds of vegetables and herbs grown here are cabbage, colza or rape, celery, kohlrabi, and perhaps the most famous, savoury. Similar to basil and mint, Tra Que savoury is very popular in many restaurants and hotels in Hoi An for its special fragrance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn recognition of the local farmers skills, people here all refer to them as “artistes”. Thanks to their special products, the village has become an attractive destination for tourists. It has been a highlight for visitors to Hoi An since the first tour to the village was opened in 2004.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom Hoi An’s centre, Hoi An Travel Company takes visitors on one-day or half-day tours to Tra Que, which gives them a chance to discover the daily life of farmers and try their hands out at actual farming. Visitors can participate in such activities like tilling the land, sowing the seeds, watering, fertilizing, harvesting and so on.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis tour is attracting a lot of people, especially foreign tourists. In recent years, Hoi An Travel has been taking more than 1,000 tourists to visit Tra Que Village annually, gaining hundreds of million of Dong.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVisitors to the village will be welcomed at two guest-houses before being taken to the plantation by a local farmer to see and join his work. If they stay for a whole day, lunch will be served at the guest house with Hoi An’s special dishes. After that, visitors can relax with a foot massage using medical herbs before saying goodbye to the farmers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"I really enjoy the work as I never have worked on a farm before,\" shared on Irish visitor joining in a full-day tour with us. “Besides learning the work of farmers in Vietnam, I can relax and do exercise at the same time.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith a steady income from both farming and tourism, living standards for residents has improved significantly, all thanks to the humble herb.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:00', '2010-12-26 10:24:00'),

An old woman straddles her and, with rhythmic sweeping motions, rubs a silver coin into the exposed flesh. Thuy\'s back is covered in bruises – vivid purple stripes extending symmetrically outwards from her spine. On a nearby bed two children are playing cards. In a hammock an old man is snoring. Nobody seems interested in the torture scene being enacted under their noses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nActually, this is not torture but an everyday slice of life. When I first arrived I was bewildered by the number of people walking around with grotesque markings on their skin – women with purple bruises running down their necks; shirtless men flaunting the tracery of welt marks across their backs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnlightenment came abruptly and comically. I arranged to meet a pretty Vietnamese girl in a restaurant. In I walked, and there she sat, smiling sweetly, apparently oblivious to the purple blemishes all over her neck. My first thought was: \"Lovebites!\" I didn\'t tell her this, instead gently broaching the subject of her neck ... er … injuries. Whereupon she burst out laughing and initiated me into the world of cao gio.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn England, if you have a headache or a pain, you take aspirin. In Vietnam you allow your body to be scraped with a coin, or spoon or similar object. The skin is first lubricated with a balm or oil and the coin is rubbed firmly and repeatedly in a linear pattern until blood appears under the skin. This is cao gio (pronounced \"cow yaw\"), which literally means \"catch the wind\". Illnesses are believed to be caused by an excess of wind and cao gio is believed to release the excess wind and restore balance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDoes it work? The Vietnamese seem to think so, but, to my sceptical Western mind, it is the patient\'s belief in the efficacy of cao gio, plus the therapeutic effect of massaging that are responsible for any cure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCao gio – along with herbalists, acupuncturists, sorcerers, fortune-tellers and priests – is an indelible part of Vietnamese medicine. More than anything, cao gio is a social bond, a link with the past and with your neighbours – a highly visible sign that you are part of tradition and truly Vietnamese.

Moments of clarity. Moments where I\'m transported to the past. Moments where a scene is truly something to behold. And then there\'s madness again and the world\'s going too fast, and Hanoi\'s spreading up and out but it\'s not like watching grass grow. I feel that if I don\'t get out the way, they\'ll be entombing me in bricks and mortar, giving me a lick of paint and setting up a teashop out front.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore that happens and before Hanoi completes its total morphing into just another big Asian metropolis minus its distinctive wet markets and street eateries, its corners of crumbling colony, its conical hat-wearing vendors, I want to issue an invitation to anyone who\'s reading to visit and eat in Hanoi now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI want to do that by enticing you with a run-down of Hanoi as a food destination.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI purchase sticky rice for breakfast each morning from my neighbor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe live in a labyrinth of lanes in Nghi Tam, a sleepy district of Hanoi on the banks of West Lake. In the shadow of the Sheraton Hotel, our other neighbors concern themselves with either market gardens lined with cumquat trees or ponds and green bottles containing black fighting fish, sold in plastic bags for young men to gamble over. At 6.45am, trade in cumquat bushes and fish is slow. Sticky rice trade is brisk.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom a round bamboo basket covered in woven rattan mats, she digs a bowlful out, places it on a sheet of clear plastic, spoons on a mix of crushed peanut, sesame seed and salt before wrapping my morning meal in a page of some student’s homework. In years gone by, it would have been a banana leaf. The homework or an old electricity bill is other-worldly enough for me. Hanoi’s food culture is intriguing in unusual respects, even after eight years of residency here.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI still bike the streets with wonder at the pervasive nature of food in this city. At any moment, at least one sense is being somehow subtly seduced. It may be a vision of a pineapple seller fanning herself against a fading ochre wall, spiked yellow peel piled beside her. The mournful cries of ngo nong day (hot corn here) or banh bao nong day (hot steamed buns here) intimate that food is available, on two wheels and right by my front gate, mid-afternoon or close to midnight. A hefty whiff on the air seeps up and down the corridors of Hanoi’s old quarter signaling that fish sauce is being used in a cooking process. In late summer, the feel on the tongue of luscious longan flesh coming away from its shiny black marble of a pip is almost erotic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor Hanoians, food is essentially fuel but it does dominate its fair share of conversations. A typical lunch in the capital centers around the staple: rice. In this part of the world, it is a wonder this grain does not have a capital letter. Admissions have been uttered to me, by some locals, to the effect that if they don\'t get their fill of this stuff for a few days, they feel physically sick, that something is not quite right inside.<br />\r\nStreet fruits Jack fruit<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile an afternoon nap generally follows lunch, evidenced by prostrate bodies on sidewalks, on desks in offices, on motorbike seats with legs dangling over the handle bars, behind market stalls with magazines over faces, it is not long before food comes to the fore again. Afternoons are consumed with heated bargaining over fruit. In the late summer, negotiations are barked over the stunning pink beauty of dragon fruit being sold off the backs of bicycles. In autumn, custard apples, pomelos and persimmons arrive by truck under cover of darkness at the bustling, heaving Long Bien market. They are distributed among an army of pavement pounding and pedaling street vendors in the hours before dawn. In winter, an array of citrus varieties is on offer. In this sub-tropical city, if the seasons cannot be easily detected by the weather conditions, observing the fruit rolling through the streets is an alternative method. If it’s lychees, it must be summer.<br />\r\nDry shrimps Dong Xuan market.</p>\r\n<p>The streets are restaurants, though, as much as they are markets. Walking on the pavements of Hanoi is simply not an option. If it is not a parked motorbike forcing a step down onto the road, it will be a curbside eatery. A million miniature maroon and blue plastic stools and tables litter the pedestrian zones of this city. Two dishes predominate amongst the exhaust fumes and chaos of the Vietnam capital’s roads, streets and narrow alleyways.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPho, the most renowned, is a rice noodle soup, traditionally made only with beef and originally from Northern Vietnam. Even though Hanoi is just a few weeks away from its 1000th anniversary, pho\'s history is short and scantily documented, The Chinese and the French are said to have influenced this defining dish in Vietnam’s cuisine. The French occupation had much to do with the inclusion of beef in the diet, a meat probably considered extravagant by the Vietnamese at that time because of the contribution of the cow in the field. The Chinese connection can be seen in the use of noodles, ginger, star anise and clove.</p>\r\n<p>Whatever its origins, the Vietnamese have well and truly taken ownership of this dish. While regional variation is rife, the most obvious differences occurring in the south where the noodles are thinner, the stock sweeter and the herbs more abundant, a pho purist would champion the simplicity of Hanoi pho: a clear, well-balanced but beefy broth, hints of ginger and spice evident but not overpowering, noodles flash dunked to perfection, a smattering of herbs and a decent mound of tai, beef cooked rare under the pour of the ladle. Hardly ever prepared at home, due to the complicated and time-consuming processes and the myriad of ingredients required, pho has evolved from what was a special weekend breakfast treat into the comfort food of a nation, available morning, noon and night.<br />\r\nold favourite<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHanoi’s other culinary masterpiece is bun cha. Popular as lunch fare only, every road, street and tiny rabbit warren serves up this dish somewhere along its length. Hand-fan powered plumes of smoke signal a bun cha eatery’s location. This dish is basically meat grilled over hot coals served in a dipping sauce with bun (vermicelli rice noodles) and a tangle of different herbs on the side.</p>\r\n<p>The meat is pork, formed into little patties with garlic and shallots, as well as an egg, fish sauce and sugar marinade. A variation has the patties wrapped in la lot (wild betel leaf), adding a slight zest to the flavour. Pork belly is also utilized for this meal, sliced into a thick bacon-like cut, marinated in the fish sauce potion, caged up in the wire griller with the patties and fan-cooked to well-done, edged with crunchy charcoal. Herbs and noodles are dunked in the bowl of dipping sauce containing the meat feast, acting as a dressing for the greenery and a loosener for the vermicelli. This soup cum sauce consists of the usual suspects: fish sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, lime juice and water. Normally lukewarm, it can be doctored to taste with chili, garlic and pepper tableside. Bun cha is the great Vietnamese barbeque!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNumerous other Hanoi specialties mark the city’s streets, some challenging to western sensibilities and palates. Dog meat (thit cho) is the most obvious example. The traditional seven dish dog spread is reserved for special occasions at certain times of the lunar calendar to ward off bad luck and enliven virility. Pigs’ intestines (long lon) are more routine in the cuisine, enjoyed in rice porridge for breakfast or served among generous sprigs of Asian basil (rau hung que) for lunch. The dipping sauce for both of these delicacies is perhaps the most confronting ingredient in the entire cuisine. Known as mam tom, it has a potent aroma, half petrol and half fish. It is best translated as fermented shrimp sauce and, in my time in Hanoi, I’m yet to acquire the taste, even when the olfactory organ is being pinched with my fingers!</p>\r\n<p>Washing the after-taste away presents no problem. Bia Hoi is draught beer served on the street, pulled direct from the keg, sometimes through a proper tap, sometimes enticed down a siphon by a quick suck of air from the beer-tender\'s lungs. It is available all over town, from big halls with huge menus to one keg stools on the pavement. After a meal of dog or intestines and mam tom, a few large tumblers will likely ease the experience into the past. A non-alcoholic alternative is sugar cane juice (mia da); a striking light green beverage extracted from the passing of sugar cane rods through a metal juicer contraption and poured over a half glass of crushed ice. In the oven-hot temperatures of a Hanoi summer, this refreshment momentarily halts the human melt.</p>\r\n<p>My wonder at the epicurean experiences I’ve had in Vietnam’s capital are unlikely to halt.

Visitors can fish in the river and plough the fields with a buffalo.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe homestay service was introduced at the village about a year ago and organized by the community with the Green Future Fund, which supports local people with capital and guidance. The project has a very altruistic side. Many of the families involved used to make a living illegally exploiting the forest around the heritage site for timber and wild animals. The homestays provided the farmers with an alternative means to subsidize their meager incomes. Now, most of the wooden houses in the village have been refurnished to welcome tourists.</p>\r\n<p>Even when you want a break from working the land, a simple bicycle tour will find you retracing the steps of Vietnam’s history. One can follow a winding road past a forest management station and find themself meandering along a section of the historic Ho Chi Minh Trail, witness to many fierce battles during the American War, the scars of which can still be seen today. It is very humbling to look up from the historic trail at the timeless backdrop of mountains, unchanged for centuries.</p>\r\n<p>After about 10km, the trail leads past a steep slope and into an immense field. You will find yourself at a river bank where a boat waits to take you back to Chay Lap. Those who like kayaking can explore the surrounding on a different route. Rowing along Chay River, you can visit Toi Cave and admire the breathtaking beauty of mountain cliffs and catch a glimpse of the many grey Langur (Voọc duoi dai) and other endangered animals and birds that live in Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park.</p>\r\n<p>A number of tour agents work with the village to promote their homestay service.

Built in 1959, it became a network of tracks, roads, and waterways running from North to South Viet Nam, passing through Laos and Cambodia. It provided logistical support to the National Liberation Front (Viet Cong) and the North Vietnamese Army. In the early days it would take about six months to go between North to South, on foot or by bicycles or ponies. Throughout the American War the trail had carried more than one million North Vietnamese soldiers and vast quantities of war supplies to battlefields in the Southern war zones. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs we passed by a series of mountains along the Truong Son Range, I was told the Americans had dropped at least four million tons of bombs along the trail during the war. The numbers of Vietnamese deaths and wounded were also in the millions. Aside from Agent Orange, the Americans also sprayed other types of chemical defoliants. In addition, they created rain by seeding clouds, in turn producing mudflows -- attempting to destroy the jungle path. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was in the 90\'s, when Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet authorized the construction of the entire trail with concrete materials. Its width was increased up to four times. The newly built road also became highly beneficial to tribal Hmong families as it enabled them to travel from the remote mountain sites to towns and cities. Many Hmongs could do direct trading with the Kinh people, which is the majority ethnic group in Vietnam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter nearly four hours of smooth travelling and admiring the beauty of the wilderness, we arrived in Thanh Hoa. There, we attended the ceremony of the 100th day following the re-burial of the 22nd emperor of the Le dynasty, Le Du Tong, who had reigned from 1705 to1729. Like all the 27 Le emperors, Du Tong had been buried in a secret location in Thanh Hoa. Forty six years ago, when a farmer was digging up the soil, he accidentally un-earthed the emperor\'s tomb. The government decided to keep the remains inside the National History Museum in Ha Noi for research. When Du Tong was first buried in 1731, his body was embalmed and dressed in 13 layers of silk gowns containing preservatives. Finally, last spring he was returned to Thanh Hoa, with a grand ceremony. His new tomb will become one of the great memorial sites. To prepare for the second burial, the local authorities had to widen the village roads to allow the 400 cars and trucks into the site. On the date of the burial, many young children climbed up into the trees to watch the coffin being lowered into the ground. Overloaded with the children, many branches fell and broke. Miraculously, nobody was injured. The locals said the emperor had protected them. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 100th day ceremony was scheduled to begin at 3pm. However, the monks had decided to wait for us as we did not arrive until 4pm. At this ceremony, I was given the rare honor to present a scroll written in calligraphy by a Buddhist monk containing my personal wish to the Emperor\'s spirit. He is called \"the elder gentleman\". Something strange would happen soon. In that same week, I was invited to Dien Bien Phu for the commemoration of the 56th anniversary of the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. The trip would take 4 days by road, with stopovers in Moc Chau and Lai Chau. The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nguyen Thanh Son, would lead the group. I badly wanted to visit the great old battlefield. However, I had already scheduled another trip to the Mekong Delta, concerning my charity. It would not be possible for me to include Dien Bien Phu. While feeling the anxiety, I made a prayer to \"the elder gentleman\". To my pleasant surprise, the dates for Dien Bien Phu were suddenly changed and we would leave Ha Noi two days earlier. The revised departure date was perfect for me, as I would be able to make the trip to the Mekong Delta after returning from Dien Bien Phu. Did the \"elder gentleman\" answer my prayer or was it pure chance? In either case, I felt that some spiritual force had blessed me for having committed myself to the charity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe left the burial site in the evening. On the way back to Ha Noi, we stopped at a little restaurant near a mountain site for dinner. The pleasant waitress served us charcoal grilled wild boar. This was accompanied by fried farmer chicken, steamed fish with green bananas, and boiled wild vegetables. That was an exceptionally delicious meal. We returned to the comfortable car and were driven smoothly along. I enjoyed listening to many heart-felt war songs. The long trail circling the Truong Son mountains was most serene and one could hear the whispering of the night wind. The sky was pitch dark: mysterious, calm, and melancholic. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy journey to Dien Bien Phu a few days later included another series of scenic routes and also rough and muddy roads. The group enjoyed various local cuisines, including wild boar and buffalo meat. Early morning the next day we arrived at a hilltop overlooking the old battlefield. The grand ceremony for the deceased soldiers was solemn and powerful. The event was organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Buddhist Association. Nearly 100 monks and nuns were present, with a huge crowd attending each day. The great altar was filled with many varieties of fresh fruits, prepared food, and drinks. Lots of beautiful orchids and chrysanthemums were on display. Together with other overseas Vietnamese, I visited the large cemetery of the unknown soldiers. At each tomb, we lit incense for the deceased. One of the most moving aspects of the whole occasion was the consideration shown to the soldiers on both sides of the war who had died for their countries. On our last day at Dien Bien Phu, we went up to General Vo Nguyen Giap\'s old headquarters on top of a very steep hill. Climbing was hard physical labor. I wondered about the task of pulling the many heavy cannons uphill. I thought of the thousands of Vietnamese, known and unknown, who had lost their lives at this battle. We owe them our way of life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs soon as I returned from Dien Bien Phu, I made a second trip to Thanh Hoa, this time with Brooke Balza, an American documentary photographer. A devoted member of the charity, she wanted to obtain many photographs of the children victims of Agent Orange. They are of the third generation of those originally infected. Witnessing their physical deformity was most disturbing. With the photos, we will hold international exhibitions to raise money in order to build therapy and skill centres in Thanh Hoa and other provinces. During the American War, a large number of young men and women from Thanh Hoa had gone South to join the nationalist forces. Of these, at least 22,000 were infected by Agent Orange. Thanh Hoa itself had also suffered massive bombing raids. In the mid 60\'s, when the United States started their seven year campaign against North Viet Nam with \"Operation Rolling Thunder\", the Thanh Hoa Bridge was a strategic target for repeated attacks. So many B-52 bombers were shot down from this bridge that the proud local residents changed its name to \"Dragon\'s Jaw Bridge\". <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI now anticipate many future trips to Thanh Hoa. And I would love to travel along the Ho Chi Minh trail again. One day I would like to go along the trail all the way to the Mekong Delta. </p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:09', '2010-12-26 10:24:09');

After the grasshopper appetizer, there were choices of grilled goat teat or raw cobra heart.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis was just another typical meal in Vietnam, especially when you\'re traveling with Portland restaurateurs Lam Van and Elizabeth Nguyen, owners of Portland\'s Pho Van and Silk restaurants.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLast March, they led a group of seven couples, along with their favorite wine distributor, Holly Wing, on a two-week culinary adventure through Vietnam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStarting in the French-influenced capital of Hanoi, we stopped in Halong Bay to the north; Hue and Ho An in central Vietnam; and finished in Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta. Along the way, Lam and Elizabeth made sure that the meals were a constant -- and sometimes startling -- highlight.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Northern Vietnam</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nRooftop restaurant Highway 4 was our first foray into full-contact adventure eating. With crunchy grasshoppers, fried softshell crabs, spicy squid, baby fish and seasoned mountain vegetables, our first meal in Hanoi was one of our best.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlong with dinner, we sampled a variety of Vietnamese snake wines, which have the smoky taste of a weak Scotch and are essentially the same as Japanese Habu Sake -- with the addition of a fermented snake in the bottle. We also tried scorpion and cobra wine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeated on the floor under a teak trellis, with a Buddhist altar behind us and piles of Vietnamese delicacies in front of us, we felt alone in the mountains of northern Vietnam. But the snake wine can make it tough to get off the floor. (5 Hang Tre St., 84 43 926 0639, http://highway4.com)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter a day spent touring the Perfume Pagoda outside Hanoi, our second dinner was far more traditional, and one that Lam and Elizabeth were particularly excited about. We enjoyed a late-night dinner at Le Verticale, where we took over the entire third floor of an elegantly restored four-story French colonial villa. With wide plank floors, gentle candlelight and ultramodern dinnerware, the room could have just as easily been in a townhouse in Ile Saint-Louis in Paris as Hanoi.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBrittany native Didier Corlu started Le Verticale two years ago after several years as the executive chef at Hanoi\'s Sofitel Metropole. He has artistically melded his native French cooking with the rich flavors and ingredients of Vietnam to produce one of Hanoi\'s top restaurants. In fact, the first floor of the villa is an elaborate spice shop.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur six-course tasting menu included wild prawns with spring roll and sweet and sour apple, Corlu\'s signature ocean escabeche, pan-fried duck liver foie gras with Daikon turnip and tamarind juice, red tuna with citronella and passion fruit, Didier\'s own \"le Corlu\" cheese and soft cake of chocolate and cinnamon. Each course was as artistically presented as it was exquisitely prepared. While we just enjoyed Didier\'s handiwork, he also offers cooking classes every Sunday. (19 Ngo Van So St., 84 43 944 6317, http://verticale-hanoi.com)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Central Vietnam</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom Hanoi, we headed to Hue, where we toured the remains of the old Imperial Citadel. The palace, being restored, was badly damaged during the Vietnam War, and bullet marks scar much of the stonework.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt a Royal Hue dinner at Restaurant Royal Park, our entire group dressed in Vietnamese imperial costumes. Peter Bishop and Janet Williamson presided as the Emperor and Empress of the Court. While the \"ancient banquet\" was not the culinary highlight of our adventures, traditional song, dance and instruments, as well as the elaborate decorative presentation of the dishes, provided a glimpse of Vietnamese royal life 100 years ago. (38-43 Nguyen Sinh Sac St., Vi Da, 84 54 389 7202)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom Hue, we headed to the resort town of Hoi An, almost as famous for its tailors, who can produce virtually anything overnight, as it is for its beaches. Our group spent several hours at the Yaly tailor (47 Nguyen Thai Hoc, 84 510 391 4995), having suits, saris and caftans custom-made. Hoi An was the perfect place to relax before the excitement awaiting us in Saigon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Southern Vietnam</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn our first night there, we went to rooftop restaurant 3T Vietnamese Barbecue, which was teeming with young Vietnamese, occasional expatriates and a few other tourists. The roof deck has a retractable roof, and every table has its own small propane-operated grill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor the first course, we grilled seasoned boar, venison and goat breast to our liking, and then finished our skewers with fermented tofu dipping sauces. While the goat was a little chewy, the venison was absolutely delicious. Charred fresh okra made for a crispy side dish. Smoke engulfed the open-air restaurant, adding further ambience, and heat, to Saigon\'s tropical humidity. The meat course was followed by shrimp, which were brought out skewered alive, wiggling and ready to grill. With plenty of ice-cold Vietnamese beer, we spent hours enjoying the smoky rooftop. (29 Ton That Thiep, District 1, 84 83 821 1631)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe also spent a day on the famous Mekong Delta, which has been the scene of so many American movies about the Vietnam War. Today, it is a busy commercial waterway and site of fish farming. We toured several of the smaller islands in the delta and sampled the local coconut candy and rice wine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReturning from the delta, we had our final dinner in Ho Chi Minh City at the Quan An Bistro, which offered a more traditional colonial Vietnam setting, in stark contrast to most of the city\'s sleek modern restaurants. But the food offered the same rich diversity of tastes and textures that are one of the hallmarks of Vietnam.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:10', '2010-12-26 10:24:10'),

The well’s position peaks out at the edge of the ocean.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKing’s Well is over 1 metre in diametre and 6 metres deep. It was built with boulders and its water level is remarkably stable making it very easy to take water from the well.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to locals, during rainy season, King’s Well’s water can spill over the top and run into the sea. There are another 3 or 4 water wells but in summer, they are often dried up or mixed with seawater.

One such legend says that Gia Long King had built the well. The story goes that when the King visited the islands lying along the seashore of the central area, he came to Ly Son Island. By that time, locals were coping with a very severe drought. He conducted a rite asking for help from God. After the rite, he was told in a dream about the location where he should dig up a well. The next day, a well was dug up at the place in which he dreamt. After that, people named it “Gia Long well” or “Well from the King”.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another legend says that during the time when Nguyen Anh (is the name of Gia Long King before he regained his throne) was pursued during the Tay Son revolt, he hid on Ly Son Island. During a very hot summer, food and fresh water was running out. He dug many wells but none of them had water. When the lives of Nguyen Anh and his warriors were hanging on the balance, he dreamt about the position where he should dig a well, leading him to dig in this location.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, according to historical records, Nguyen Anh never ever came to Ly Son Island during the Tay Son revolt.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many believe the most likely origin of this well is that it was dug up hundreds years ago by Cham people, a group of people who were living on Ly Son Island. Many central provinces have a “King‘s Well” like this one. They are often positioned near the sea and built with rocks or bricks by ancient people.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cham people were very knowledgeable about the Chinese art of fengshui, which helped they find fresh water sources in the most unlikely locations.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nevertheless, no matter how the well came about, its name, “King’s Well”, expresses the high appreciation of people who have used this fresh water source for hundreds of years.<em><br />\r\n</em></p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:11', '2010-12-26 10:24:11'),

Perhaps because all this activity takes place in a hot, fecund atmosphere of incense, drains and street food, HCMC feels more visceral than sanitised cities such as New York or London.</p>\r\n<p>While the new high rises and recently opened international luxury brand outlets might point to Vietnam\'s possible future, old Saigon and the past are never far away. The Vietnamese refer to the conflict fought between 1964-75 as the American War and many of HCMC\'s most popular attractions are linked to those events. The War Remnants Museum is a sobering and gruesomely graphic testament to the inhuman carnage of the war while, an hour or so outside the city, the Cu Chi tunnels, an underground wartime stronghold, offer very definite clues as to why the Vietcong were the eventual victors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAny people who are prepared to live and fight in a maze of tight, booby-trapped tunnels for 20 years have a level of determination and tenacity which counts for far more than sheer firepower.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter crawling through a sweaty, airless, 20-metre section of the tunnels, which had been especially widened for westerners, I had had enough. At its peak, the sprawling subterranean complex may have sported hospitals, dormitories and even dance floors but living there is almost unimaginable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout 700 miles north of Saigon, the capital Hanoi is more elegant than its thrusting southern counterpart but it is still a long way from sedate. Once colonial France\'s administrative centre in Vietnam, parts of Hanoi boast boulevards and yellow painted townhouses and look as though they have been dropped in from Paris. Although Ho Chi Minh\'s mausoleum, where the Vietnamese queue for hours to see the embalmed remains of their former leader, owes more to Moscow\'s Red Square than the Champs Élysée.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, there is more fun to be had in the 36 Streets area of the old quarter. Dating back to the 13th century, this warren of streets was the focus for the city\'s trades and merchants and each street had its own speciality. Even today, there are entire streets dedicated to selling padlocks or towels or mysterious dried roots.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe perched on little stools at a crossroads pavement bar in the old quarter and supped 15p glasses of draught beer while snacking on dried squid heated over a charcoal brazier. Every now and then the police would come along and order all the stools to be moved off the road. Naturally, as soon as they were gone, all the stools moved back into the road with predictably chaotic consequences for the streams of mopeds passing through.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven at 6am, Hanoi has a bit of pace to it. In the centre of the city is the Hoan Kiem Lake, home to a mythical turtle. By night, the lake is ringed with young, courting couples. Not long after daybreak, it is surrounded by folk doing Tai Chi, playing badminton or keepie-up with a shuttlecock in the city\'s cool morning air.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOutwith the cities, the pace slows even if the day still tends to start early. From Hanoi, we took the sleeper train to Sapa, an old hill station close to the Chinese border. Sapa is an increasingly popular base for trekking in the surrounding mountains. It is also close to the tiny town of Bac Ha, which is notable for its Sunday market.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA social affair as much as a chance to trade, it attracts tribes such as the Black H\'mong and Red Tsao from all over the surrounding countryside. Many of the women still wear traditional dress. We pitched up about 7am, around the same time that the locally distilled rice spirit starts being decanted from its five-gallon containers. As well as offering the chance to catch up with neighbours from across the valley, the market is like Tesco\'s, B&Q and a grooming parlour all rolled into one for the locals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEverything is for sale at Bac Ha, from ploughs to ponies via python fat which looks like clusters of fat broad beans and is, apparently, good for skin burns. Locally grown tobacco sits in mounds along with pipes for customers who want to try before buying. Piglets are pulled squealing out of sacks. Water buffalo are prodded and haggled over while dogs are on offer as both pets and for the pot. In one corner, four or five barbers had hung their mirrors on a wall and customers were having al fresco haircuts. My beard was a prime target which, happily, I managed to keep intact.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf the mountains of the north-west are an anthropological gold mine then the beaches of Vietnam are, for the most part, virgin territory for tourism. With over 1,000 miles of coastline, Vietnam has some stunning beaches, most yet to see the glint of a developer\'s eye. Yet its most valuable maritime asset for tourism is not a beach but the stunning Halong Bay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA Unesco world heritage site, it consists of 3,000 limestone islets in the Gulf of Tonkin. Covered in dense green vegetation, they soar up out of the sea in fairy-tale clusters. They are riddled with caves and also play host to a floating village of fishing families, complete with a floating bank and school. Of course, even several miles out to sea, Uncle Ho is still around in the form of a picture which beams down at the schoolchildren from above the classroom blackboard. We did an overnight trip around Halong Bay on a beautifully fitted out junk.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter a seafood dinner, we fished for squid using a lamp and watched the moon cast a glow over the islands. Gently bobbing on the waves, hundreds of miles from the honking motos of the mainland, it was our most peaceful night in Vietnam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuch tranquillity couldn\'t last. I woke the next morning and looked out of the porthole onto a flotilla of row boats all manned by women eager to sell their first tourist souvenir of the day. No matter what time of day or where you are in Vietnam, it is always open for business.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:13', '2010-12-26 10:24:13'),

Instead I was surprised to see how modern the country is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut honestly, the thing that really impressed me was the food, and the bakeries in particular. Although we have bakeries in Korea, the coffee and bread in the bakeries of Vietnam overwhelmed me with their flavours, a mix of tastes and textures from France and Asia, surely a remnant of the country’s colonial past.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI was in Vietnam at the invitation the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry and Asia Europe Foundation to report on an Asia-Europe Meeting workshop that took place from April 28 to 29 in Ha Long Bay in Quang Ninh Province in the northeastern corner of Vietnam. At the workshop, ASEM workshop participants agreed to forge stronger ties through cultural diplomacy linking Asia and Europe.</p>\r\n<table width=\"200\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\">\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td><img width=\"301\" vspace=\"6\" hspace=\"6\" height=\"166\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/haphuong/052010/20/15/1920584920100520154833.jpg\" /></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The sunset over Ha Long Bay. </em></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td><img width=\"300\" vspace=\"6\" hspace=\"6\" height=\"424\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/haphuong/052010/20/15/1920591720100520154834.jpg\" /></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Passengers fill their plates with food from the sumptuous buffet offered  on the cruise around Ha Long Bay (above) before going out to enjoy the  view on the deck (top).</em></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the last day of the workshop, the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry took us  on a cruise of Ha Long Bay, which covers 1,553 square kilometers (600  square miles) and has 1,969 islands. After the 10-minute ride from the  Halong Plaza Hotel where we were staying we arrived at the pier and  boarded a waiting cruise ship.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe other passengers and I sat  down at tables set out on the deck and were treated to a feast that was a  mixture of Western and Asian cuisine. Around us, thousands of limestone  islets rose out of crystalline emerald waters that glistened in the  sun.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPham Sanh Chau, director general of the department for  cultural relations and Unesco under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of  Vietnam, said Ha Long Bay is the first World Heritage Site in Vietnam.  Unesco recognized it as a World Heritage Site in 1994 and again in 2000  in recognition of its natural beauty and geological value.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Ha  Long Bay deserves to be named as one of the seven new wonders of nature  because it’s like paradise. There is nothing like it anywhere in the  world,” Chau said. “It’s not an area just for tourism. It also serves as  buffer zone against climate change. It’s rich in marine biodiversity  and many scientists say this should be a geological park.”</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As we sat back with our plates full of food, fishing boats large and small passed us on their way to their next catch. People exclaimed in excitement when they saw a small tent set up on the waters of Ha Long Bay. The tent, we learned, had been built to accommodate fishermen in need of a break or a place to sleep.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur trip around the bay was nothing if not idyllic, but our tour guide explained that tourists who visit the area usually take overnight cruises to Ha Long Bay. The cruise starts with lunch aboard the ship and continues with stops at various caves for kayaking and swimming. Guests then sleep on the boat that night.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause of my tight schedule, I had to return to my hotel that night and wasn’t able to take advantage of what sounded like a lovely diversion, but before I did I took a tour of the boat’s lower deck, where the sleeping rooms are located. The rooms are cozy and designed to accommodate two people. Each one is fully furnished with a bed, sofa, shower booth and toilet, just like in a hotel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough my journey to Vietnam was short, I picked up a few tips for my next trip that I’d like to share. First, you don’t have to set an alarm because there is an endless stream of honking motorbikes whizzing by every morning in Hanoi and the noise is enough to force your eyes open. Most Vietnamese people start the day early and most offices open at 7:30 a.m.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSecond, you need to be extremely brave when crossing the street. There are no street lights like the ones you find in other major cities. When you try to wade into the traffic that is rushing by, drivers of cars and motorcycles swerve around you without slowing down. On my first day in Hanoi, I stood on the street for 10 minutes waiting for the right time to cross when I finally found a group of Vietnamese women intent on jaywalking.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThird, although the traffic is insane, make sure you stroll around the city on foot. This is the best way to experience a typical day in the life of the Vietnamese people. Women balance poles laden with heavy baskets of vegetables and flowers on their shoulders, passing people who squat on the sidewalk or sit in plastic chairs, sipping tea and eating pho (beef noodle soup) at outdoor food stalls. This is where you can feel the energy of the people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you are planning a trip to Vietnam, I recommend you go to Hanoi first, take a tour of Hoan Kiem Lake and the Old Quarter and then take the overnight cruise of Ha Long Bay. There are travel agencies that arrange rides to the bay from Hanoi in the morning, which takes nearly four hours by car. The cruise starts at noon and the price of the overnight cruise starts at $120.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:16', '2010-12-26 10:24:16'),

Family lore was rooted in colonial Algiers, where three generations of Gregoris had lived until Algeria’s war for independence forced their return to France in 1961.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“I was raised in a family where the past took place in a dream country that didn’t exist anymore,” she said. “As an adult, I wanted to find it, and recreate it for my children.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter stints in Paris, Los Angeles, and Nevis (of which she’s also a citizen), in 1992, Ms. Gregori McKenzie, 46, settled here in Vietnam, later establishing Song, an environment-friendly line of casual wear and home linens.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut it took 11 years before she found a home where she could recreate her family’s roots. And surprisingly, it was a dimly lit, termite-infested, 40-year-old property on the Saigon River in An Phu, an affluent enclave of expatriates about a 20-minute drive from the city center.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“It was a small, shabby house,” Ms. Gregori McKenzie said. “But there was just all this river everywhere. It had the best location.” She signed the lease the same day, paying $1,500 a month in rent. (Most foreigners rent in Vietnam, as there are restrictions on owning. It is also common to pay in United States dollars.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA three-month, $60,000 renovation transformed the two-story, 940-square-foot structure and its fifth-of-an-acre grounds into a lush, barefoot-friendly haven for her twins, Tara and Aubrey, now 17 and in boarding school, and her husband, René Tayeb, 49, Song’s managing director. The family also includes two dogs, Kabul and Beirut, three cats, and 11 birds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs. Gregori McKenzie’s environmental ethos coupled with her affinity for the past sent her contractor to the city’s French colonial-era warehouses, many of which were being torn down, to salvage materials. “I wanted the feel of an old Vietnamese country house,” Ms. Gregori McKenzie said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHoles were cut into the home’s facade and filled in with mismatched shutters and windows taken from the warehouses. Their peeling frames left, as the French say, “dans son jus,” or as-is, while beamed wooden panels replaced the plastic ceilings and walls.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAntiques bought in Vietnam and Cambodia — a bow-legged side table, curvy Art Deco armchairs, carved platform beds — dominate the small rooms, while contemporary Vietnamese paintings and family photos jostle for space with geckos that scale the walls. (A fragrant homebrew of lemongrass-mint-lavender essential oils keeps the place bug-free.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe French doors that replaced the back wall open up onto an expansive stone-and-wood terrace with panoramic river views, where meals are served under broad-leaved banana trees and towering palms. “As much of life as possible takes place outside,” Ms. Gregori McKenzie said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVietnam’s plentiful jackfruit trees inspired the home’s exterior, which was repainted a chartreuse, or jackfruit green, blending in with the verdant tropical garden.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs. Gregori McKenzie added two extensions that doubled the living area: a 270-square-foot outdoor, stone-tiled kitchen and two 430-square-foot, self-standing, thatched-roof structures — one a study/TV room and the other a bathroom. Both were built from wood salvaged from a century-old wooden home of a friend. Vietnam’s heavy monsoons require that the woven-palm roofs be replaced every few years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe L-shaped worktable in the study was once a three-inch-thick ironwood bed, formerly common to Mekong Delta homes. “Each plank weighs over 200 pounds,” Mr. Tayeb said. “This stuff is everything proof.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo bedrooms were built atop the new kitchen, bringing the total number to four. Ms. Gregori McKenzie kept them small and minimally decorated, installing doors with wooden slats and painting walls red and mustard yellow to recreate “the simplicity of Caribbean life.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTermites derailed the wood floors in the downstairs living and dining rooms, so in 2005 Ms. Gregori McKenzie replaced them with gray and beige cement tiles in geometric patterns that she designed.

The coffee they drink is Vietnamese – brewed French style, of course – but the jackfruit and mango they chew on set this scene apart from anything you will see in France. This is definitely Asia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt’s an arresting moment, typical in the Vietnamese capital, which is celebrating its 1,000th birthday this year and manages to retain its old-style appeal despite the passing years and the pressure to modernise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt has all the dirt and traffic of a developing world city but combines bustle and calm in a way similar to that of a working French town in a wine region. Hanoi offers an appealing combination of gritty Vietnamese street life and relaxed postcolonial ease.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSitting on the veranda outside the Metropole hotel, one of Asia’s most famous addresses, you can check out a vintage Citroën from the 1930s and a rickshaw. Four years of renovation of this hotel, now operated by Sofitel, have sharpened its appeal but left its heritage intact. For a few delicious seconds you can imagine Graham Greene witnessing a continent in transformation, soon to re-create this vision in an enduring work of art like The Quiet American .<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe writer stayed at the Metropole – which occupies the same space in the city’s mental landscape that the Shelbourne Hotel does in Dublin – Charlie Chaplin had his honeymoon here, and more recent arrivals include Robert McNamara, John F Kennedy’s secretary of defence and the architect of the Vietnam War, whose relentless bombing campaigns brought sorrow, and a steely resolve, to the hearts of the citizens of what was then the North Vietnamese capital. Many of the legendary Vietnam War correspondents filed their stories from here.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor the first eight centuries of its existence Hanoi was a Chinese city, and you can still sense the Chinese business ethic in the way people hustle here. This is also evident in its focus on education – the first Vietnamese universities were founded here.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOriginally called Thang Long, it was renamed Hanoi in 1831, and after it became a French protectorate, in the 1880s, Hanoi was transformed into a French city, capital of the French Indo-Chinese empire. Army officers from Paris left an enduring bootprint in the solid, elegant edifices and sweeping boulevards that make Hanoi a refuge for those seeking a sense of Montpellier and Lyons to match the fascination of southeast Asia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are lots of ways to get around Hanoi, and motorbike drivers offering you a route through the city’s sclerotic traffic channels regularly approach you. Many are simply keen to practise their English and are not on the make, but it’s sometimes hard to tell when you are being hustled.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt an intersection near the Hoan Kiem Lake, in the Old Quarter, the sound of motorbikes idling is like the anticipatory moments before a Grand Prix. Tensions are high, and a motorbike bumps into a scooter, toppling a row of five bikes. There are no outraged recriminations, however, or even an exchange of telephone numbers. A young woman on the pillion of the aggrieved party’s scooter is concerned about her heels, but that’s about the extent of it. Road rage is not a big thing in Vietnam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTaxis and cyclos abound, but to get a sense of Vietnam’s capital and second-largest city it’s probably best to walk. This is not always easy to do, as this is still very much a city in the developing world, and pavements tend to trail off into gutters or, increasingly, building sites.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlong the roads of the Old Quarter, bars selling bia hoi – or light, fresh beer – jostle with new art galleries for space, each building’s address marked out on small plates with white numbers on a background left by the French.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere you can find pretty much anything you would ever need, from knock-off luggage to high-end designer clobber. The Hanoi Gallery offers reprints of stirring, beautifully worked propaganda posters, which help tourists understand how Vietnam, despite its southeast Asian tranquillity and poise, is underpinned by a toughness that has never been tamed, despite military efforts by France, Australia, the US and China in living memory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will still hear bitterness about the decision of Richard Nixon’s government to give the go-ahead to the “Christmas bombing” of Hanoi. From December 18th to 30th, 1972, waves of American B-52s dropped 40,000 tons of bombs on the mostly evacuated city. Although Washington DC said it had to be done, the world’s reaction did a lot to turn public opinion against the Vietnam War.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt’s wrong to dwell on the Vietnam conflict when in Hanoi, however, because people are keen to move on and focus on the way the city is turning into an Asian destination to compete with Thailand and Malaysia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the same time there are plenty of places to visit if you want to see the Vietnamese side of the conflict. Hoa Lo prison, infamous as the “Hanoi Hilton”, is still there, although much of the jail has been knocked down in recent years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe “Maison Centrale” sign over the door has struck fear into the hearts of generations of prisoners. John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential candidate, spent some of his five and a half years as a prisoner of war there, and his flight suit is still on display. The Hanoi Hilton is so infamous that the current Hanoi Hilton is called the Hilton Hanoi Opera Hotel, to make sure there is no mix-up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe best time to come to Hanoi is in the autumn, when the cay hoa sua trees blossom. The winter is cold and humid, the summer hot and damp.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor a southeast Asian city it’s remarkably low-rise, but there are plans afoot to dramatically expand its financial sector, and this will lead to skyscrapers. This is a good time to go to Hanoi before it catches up with the rest of the world – and loses a lot of charm in the process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGo there Where to stay, where to eat and where to go in Hanoi city <br />\r\n<br />\r\n5 places to stay <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSofitel Legend Metropole. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n15 Ngo Quyen Street, 00-84-4- 38266919, sofitel.com/asia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince its refurbishment this colonial-style landmark hotel boasts 364 rooms, three restaurants, three bars, a swimming pool and a high-end spa, among other attractions.

The man and his horse will use all their skills and determination to win the race and bring pride to their village.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe winner of the 2009 race, jockey Vang Van Thuc (30 years old, of Tay ethnic descent, from Na Hoi Tay Hamlet, Na Hoi Commune) shares, \"We don\'t use a saddle on our horse. We use a rectangular piece of linen that we bind across their back and a rope that we use for their rein. It\'s impossible for us to whip the horse since we have to use both of our hands to control the horse and keep our balance. As easy as this may sound, it\'s not easy to do. There is only one spot on the back of the horse that allows us to keep our balance. Our two legs would have to grip tight to the sides of the horse and we have to adjust our body up and down according to the horse\'s running rhythm. If we accidentally fall, we have to know how to fall to avoid serious injuries.\" <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince the beginning of May, Bac Ha District has been busy preparing for the 2010 Horse Race and it was reported that organisers for this year\'s event have been selected. The race this year is going to be held on a larger scale. It is estimated that over 150 horses will participate in the march before the race and about 100 will compete in a 1,500 metre race.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe horse race is an annual event of Bac Ha District in response to the tourism program of 3 provinces: Lao Cai - Yen Bai - Phu Tho. It has been considered a highlight tourist attraction. According to the district\'s statistics, the 2009 horse race welcomed 15,000 visitors both domestic and international.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img width=\"500\" vspace=\"6\" hspace=\"6\" height=\"372\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://i.dtinews.vn/stores/news_dataimages/haphuong/052010/17/11/dua-ngua-120100517110742.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A bare-foot jockey</em></p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:20', '2010-12-26 10:24:20'),

Traditional Vietnamese dishes are served on board along with bountiful alcohol and Pringles for Happy Hour cravings.<br />\n<br />\nIt takes a few days to get deep enough into the bay where you really feel as though you’re on another planet. A day or two, and all you see are the thousands of cliffs jutting out of the lagoon-colored water and nothing else. You forget which way’s east and west, and living on a houseboat with pet dolphins could easily be your reality.<br />\n<br />\nWe stopped on one island and spent the night in a hotel where we had a group dinner with the rest of our boat. Vietnamese like to be in charge, have things done a certain way, and don\'t understand independence, so we didn\'t get away with trying to hide away in our room enjoying some solace when dinner was served. It made me feel like I was on a cruise vacation where every minute of an itinerary is planned for you.<br />\n<br />\nAfter spending so much time in Thailand, “the Land of Smiles,” I found a lot lost in the translation with the Vietnamese. The language already sounds aggressive, and their body language and facial expressions tend to be serious and dominating. I felt like I was getting yelled at when someone was asking how dinner was, and the feeling went way beyond the obvious American guilt for Vietnam and our role in their history.<br />\n<br />\nWe did a hike into the jungle and took in panoramic views of absolute beauty. There were the usual colorful birds and monkeys as we trekked behind our sandal-clad guide in hiking boots and moisture-wicking shirts in a way that made us feel like typical tourist Americans. There was a supposed tiger on the island, but surprisingly, we didn\'t see it on our trek.<br />\n<br />\nWe cruised alongside the cliffs by day, stopping at colorful floating markets with every fruit imaginable and observing the various communities living on houseboats in this enchanted bay.<br />\n<br />\nWe kayaked one morning at sunset and it was the most peaceful, surreal time I\'ve ever had. It definitely aroused the, \"Am I really here right now?

In Australia my feet are considered small. In Vietnam they are thought humungous. And you will never feel more like a lumbering plebeian than when your European size 38s have been tittered at by the dainty-footed shoe salespeople in Hanoi, who delight in telling you the biggest size they have in stock is 37.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor days in Vietnam - having overlooked packing heels and being in need of them for a function - I had been roaming around like Prince Charming and his slipper, only with the inverse quest. He was seeking a foot to fit a shoe. I was searching for a shoe to fit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was in the mountain resort town of Dalat that I suddenly felt like Cinderella the moment she slipped her hoof into that glass slipper.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI had asked the desk staff at my hotel if there was a place in town where I might find Western-sized shoes. A yes was followed by directions quickly drawn on a map, followed by - eureka - not only a pair of heels that fit but a gorgeous pair for the equivalent of $17.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI put them on for dinner that night and did indeed feel like a princess.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut then, I was already feeling pretty regal, because if there\'s another thing that can make a person feel like a princess, it\'s a palace - and I was staying at the Sofitel Dalat Palace.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd if there is one more, it\'s a bed where real royalty has slept. On a recent state visit, none other than Princess Mary and Prince Frederik of Denmark stayed in the same suite I occupied.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt had french double doors and a balcony revealing a view beyond the main road of Dalat\'s stunning Xuan Huong Lake.

It is now the honeymoon and summer break of choice for well-to-do Vietnamese, as well as a wonderful respite from the heat for international tourists, with roads meandering through the succulent fields of what is Vietnam\'s food bowl. (The Dalat strawberries are out of this world.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1922 the French government opened the Langbian Palace Hotel, the now Sofitel Dalat Palace.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt became the landmark around which the rest of town developed. Ten years later, the government opened the Hotel du Parc across the road to meet the increasing number of tourists and hunting enthusiasts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, the two hotels comprise one complex under the same management. Guests of the delightful four-star Mercure Dalat du Parc have access to Sofitel Dalat Palace\'s tennis courts, gym and bars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Sofitel Dalat Palace has a mere 43 rooms over two floors. It is full of art and elegant decor, which will soon be updated under the charge of the new Australian general manager, who vows the change will simply ensure the property continues to meet Sofitel\'s high standards.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe five-hectare grounds are all rolling lawn and hedges, giving the feeling of a grand country estate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ground floor public areas add to that.

The old village was located along the river bank of the Rao Cai River. Hundreds of small streams from Truong Son Range gather here in this huge river, a river that has supported the life of its locals for generations. However, it can also be wild and raging bringing great danger to people during the rainy season every year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince the early twentieth century, a dam was expected to be built by the French in Vietnam, but due to World War II and later the Indochina War, the construction was stopped. Finally, on March 26, 1976, when Vietnam was reunified as one nation, the dam was built and completed by Vietnamese irrigation companies. It was named Ke Go and put into use on February 3, 1988.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKe Go Lake is located in the area of 3 districts; Cam Xuyen, Ky Anh and Huong Khe. The lake is a large irrigation work with the water volume of 350 million cubic metres, enough water supply for almost 17,000 hectares of rice distributed in districts Thach Ha and Cam Xuyen, Ha Tinh Commune and north of Ky Anh District. At 30 kilometres in length, the lake also provides an abundant source of food supply for the locals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs well as its practical use, the lake is a highlighted feature of the Nature Reserve. The reserve is the largest among its kind in the central area of Vietnam, covering a natural area of 35 hectares with many timber trees that are listed in the Vietnam Red Book such as green ironwood, meranti, red-wood, and frankincense. The rich and diverse flora of the reserve is representative of the flora in northern Vietnam, South China, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Himalayas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUntil now, 364 vertebrate animal species have been found in the Ke Go Nature Resrve. White-tailed wattle pheasant, one of the three endemic pheasant types of Vietnam, is currently at risk of extinction. Among 47 mammal species here, 18 were recorded in the Vietnam Red Book and world Red List. Ke Go Forest is home to many beautiful and different types of flowers such as magnolias and orchids. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe lake also has numerous oasis.

One reason for this is that travel agents only organise trips for visitors to see the pagodas scenery and architecture, not to explore the culture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout 30 speeches followed by discussions with practical ideas focusing on the theme \"Hue Pagodas and Tourism\" took place at the \"Buddhist Cultural Relics and Tourism Development of Hue Conference\", held on May 7 in Hue City.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the conference, researchers discussed many pros and cons and many differing possibilities, with the aim of determining whether spiritual tourism could attract visitors on a large scale.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to researcher Nguyen Phuoc Bao Dan, Hue pagodas were classified into two types, small and simple ones placed deep inside the forest and grand ones decorated in sophisticated style.

During the twentieth century, specifically after Vietnam\'s Reunification, pagodas have become must-visit destinations for all tours to Hue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany ideas were introduced, and one of them, \"Hue Buddhism Musical Festival\", would allow visitors to actively take part in Buddhist rituals, appreciate the artistic value of Hue\'s pagodas, traditional music and bring peace to their own soul.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt present, Dong Duong Commercial Trading Travel Company has adopted this special feature on their \"Travel for Peace\" tours, which include sight-seeing, conversing and eating vegetarian meals at Dong Thuyen, Ba La Mat pagodas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"Travel for Goodwill\" tours aim at meeting and sharing stories with needy children and helpless elderly living in Dus Son Pagoda. The idea has attracted a large number of visitors both in Vietnam and from overseas to come and visit Hue\'s pagodas. There are also other tours that allow visitors to see how the Buddhist nuns hand-make their sauce, breads, cereals and incense.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr. Nguyen Huu Thong, the head of the Vietnam Art and Culture Institute in Hue suggested that tours to old temples located in the villages could also be arranged. \"The temple as the main destination along with the beautiful and natural rural settings of the villages would create an important opportunity for agricultural tourism and folklore tourism to develop. Tourists will be able to explore many traditional and special characteristics of Hue villages themselves,\" Thong added.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn response to what could possibly be done to attract a large number of visitors to Hue\'s pagodas, Dr. Tran Duc Anh Son, Deputy Director of Da Nang Institute for Socio-Economics Development stated, \"We should consider using one of the biggest Buddhist festivals in Hue as a lever to attract tourists. The \"Quan The Am\" (Avalokitesvara) Festival (held on June 18 -19) could be turned into a significant cultural and religious event that is held annually.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, Nguyen Dac Xuan suggested developing a \"Spiritual-tourism Festival\" project, in which he set out the content, purposes, members, and organisation methods for a special Buddhist festival that could be held every two years during the odd-numbered years of Buddha\'s birthday (full moon April).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to statistics from Thua Thien - Hue Department of Culture, Sports and Tourism in 2009, the province welcomed over 1.5 million visitors and received more than VND 700 billion (USD 36 million) in revenue. However, the main type of tour was just bringing visitors to sight-see famous attractions and historical relics. With the aim to fill up their travel time, visiting the pagodas has only been a minor feature included in tours.<em><br />\r\n</em></p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:23', '2010-12-26 10:24:23'),

In fact, the course’s signature hole — the par-3 16th — backs right up against it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“No doubt that view east from 16 green — of the coastline, the ocean, the Cham Islands just offshore — is going to slow down play,” said Howie Roberts, general manager of Danang Golf Club. “But I’ll be shocked if anyone complains. It’s a photo opportunity if there ever was one.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to the breathtaking 16th, the minimalist Dunes Course features 17 more holes that could just as easily be lifted and placed in Australia’s Sandbelt region or along the British coastline — the only other sites where Norman has attempted such compelling modern links.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn fact, the par-5 10th might be even more dramatic, for the way it snakes between some of the highest dunes on the course and is angled toward the iconic Marble Mountains.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“We had a respected golf writer here a couple weeks ago who compared his round to a great song,” said Roberts. “’You just don’t want it to end,’ he said.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCredit that feeling to Norman, whose architectural chops are the result of his years of success as a world-class playing professional. He won two British Opens, finished in the top 10 of Major tournaments 30 times and held down the No. 1 ranking for an astounding 331 weeks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1987, the astute Aussie took his profound knowledge of the game and made the official jump into the design profession. He formed Greg Norman Golf Course Design (GNGCD) and the rest is history.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver the past 22 years, GNGCD has created more than 70 courses on six continents and established a reputation for imaginative designs that acknowledge golf’s traditional origins and the landscapes on which it has been played.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDanang Golf Club is the latest beneficiary of that approach. Set amid 260 hectares of tropical linksland, the Dunes Course was crafted in the spirit of the world’s most recognizable links including the Moonah Course at The National in Australia and Doonbeg in Ireland — GNGCD designs that rake in awards for their creativity, quality and environmental harmony.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the addition of Danang Golf Club, the Central Coast solidifies its status as a bona fide golf destination. The Dunes Course gives the region two tracks, including the Colin Montgomerie-designed Montgomerie Links next door. A third layout, by three-time Masters champion Nick Faldo, will soon break ground next to a bay less than an hour north of Danang.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen complete, Danang Golf Club will also feature a 3,800-square-metre clubhouse by renowned Australian architecture firm HASSELL; a comprehensive, technologically sophisticated golf academy; four- and five-star hotels; and multiple residential enclaves totaling up to 300 luxury homes.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:23', '2010-12-26 10:24:23'),

At that time, locksmithery was grouped together with such industries as coppersmithery and woodprinting which were widely popular trades for hundreds of years. Over time, locksmithery has gone through its ups and downs but it still has its place in the everyday life of Vietnamese people.</p>\r\n<p>Walking through the streets of Hanoi, very often you can come across a locksmith’s stand occupying a small place on the pavement. Almost all streets in Hanoi have one or two of such stands but the busy Luong Van Can is probably considered the locksmith street. With only a small box containing essential tools like pliers, a hammer, files, all kinds of keys, and a key-copying machine, a locksmith stand quietly exists among other simple stands such as those of a bicycle repairer, a shoes repairer, or a xe om waiting for guests. Stepping into their world, one can learn many interesting stories.</p>\r\n<p>I had chance to chat with Nguyen Ba Lan, one of the most famous locksmiths in Hanoi, about his life-long career. Lan was once famous for unlocking safes and strongboxes in all embassies and agencies in Hanoi. Starting this work when he was 12, the old artisan had many interesting stories to share. “To learn this job, you need time, caution and patience, but if you want to follow it as a career, you must have a pure conscience,” he said. “Because with just a little too much curiosity, it is very easy for a locksmith to become a thief.\" The old locksmith smiled when recalling a story from about ten years ago: A strongbox in the Embassy of China was stuck. Seven locksmiths from China had been invited but nothing changed after 12 days. Then he came and solved the problem in just 10 minutes. Skillful and honest, Lan was famous and trusted by many embassies and agencies, both local and foreign. “The Ministry of the Interior had invited me to work full-time for them but I refused because I had many other clients and especially, I had a small workshop with more than 10 understudies trying to learn the trade,” the retired artisan recalled.</p>\r\n<p>In the past, without assistance of machines, good locksmiths depended entirely on the skill of their hands. When making a new key, they meticulously filed the rough draft following the cog of the old one. To be able to solve some other complicated tasks like unlocking safes, boxes or repairing locks, they had to accumulate experience for many years.</p>\r\n<p>Today, however, with the help of key-copying machines, a new key is done in few minutes with high fidelity. Tong Viet Ha, a 15-year-experienced locksmith revealed that when hearing about the machine, he immediately bought one at VND6 million and it is helping him increase productivity greatly. These machines can work on all kinds of keys, even keys for some luxurious cars like Mercedes, Lexus, etc. “A modern locksmith should have 4 kinds of machines to make different kinds of keys. We always have to update new techniques from lock makers so as to treat the most complicated and safest locks,” Hoang said, “However, sometimes machines cannot replace the hands. For example, in the case of losing a key, locksmiths must use their skillful hands together with experience.\"</p>\r\n<p>The price for making a new key normally starts from VND4,000 for a simple one goes up with the more complicated ones. Locksmiths also earn money from repairing and unlocking services.</p>\r\n<p>Besides these stands, we can also see many “mobile” locksmiths. They have no machine or stand. With some acceptable skills, and a box containing essential tools, they can start going around crying “Sửa khoá đi (Do you want to repair lock or make new keys?).\" Such “mobile” locksmiths are not difficult to find in Hanoi. “When I started this job, it was the best way to make money as well as learn a skill,” Vu Ngoc Tu, a 19-year-old ‘mobile’ locksmith explains. “With an experienced and renowned locksmith, clients would come and find him but as a starter, I have to find my clients.”</p>\r\n<p>Tu has followed this job for 4 years since finishing high school. He learned the skills from his uncle who has a stand on Nguyen Cong Tru street. “I want to set up my own stand and buy some machines so now I am saving money. Nowadays, few young people take locksmithery as a career but I think as society develops, people will still need us.\"</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:24', '2010-12-26 10:24:24'),

Located on a granite knoll on the northern bank of the Cai river in Vinh Phuoc quarter, the Cham Towers of Po Nagar (The Lady of the City) were built between the 7th and 12th centuries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKnown as Thap Ba in Vietnamese, the site included eight towers, four of which remain, which were used for worship as early as the second century AD. Today, ethnic Cham, Chinese and Vietnamese Buddhists come to Po Nagar to pray and make offerings here, according to their respective traditions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe original wooden structure was razed to the ground by an invading troop of Javanese in 744 AD but was replaced by a stone and brick temple in 784.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe most sacred, and highest, tower is the 28-metre North Tower, with its terraced pyramid roof, vaulted interior masonry and vestibule. A superb example of Cham architecture, it was built in 817AD by Pangro, a minister of King Harivaman I, after the original temples here were sacked and burned by raiders, who made off with whatever precious metal they could find.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 918 AD, King Harivaman III placed a gold mukha-linga in this tower, but it was also stolen, this time by Khmer soldiers. In 965 AD, King Jaya Indravarman I replaced the gold mukha-linga with the stone figure, Uma – a feminine manifestation of Shiva, which remains to this day. In the tower’s main chamber, there is a black stone statute of the goddess Uma with 10 arms, two of which are hidden under her vest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Stony faces...</strong></p>\r\n<p>Situated near the tower complex, Hon Chong is a narrow granite headland that juts out towards the turquoise waters of Nha Trang bay. To the northwest is Nui Co Tien (Fairy Mountain) with three summits believed to resemble a reclining female fairy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is a gargantuan handprint-shaped indentation on one massive boulder balanced at the tip of the Hon Chong (Husband Rock). Legend has it that one day a giant was here spying on a female fairy bathing nude at Bai Tien (Fairy Beach) nearby.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe two began a life together, but the Gods soon intervened and punished the giant for his initial cheekiness, sending him off to a “re-education camp” for an indefinite sentence. The lovesick fairy patiently waited for her husband to return.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut after a very long time, despairing that he might never return, she lay down in sorrow and turned into Nui Co Tien. The peak on the right is supposed to be her face, gazing up towards the sky, the middle peak is her bosom and the apex on the left her crossed legs. When the giant returned and saw what had become of his wife, he collapsed in grief next to a boulder, leaving his handprint on it, before turning into stone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNext to Hon Chong, there is another rock called Hon Vo (Wife Rock). Locals like to say that this was a female fairy who became ‘petrified’ while waiting for her husband.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Oceanographic Institute</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Nha Trang Oceanographic Institute, founded in 1923, is housed in a French colonial building and home to an aquarium, a library and an exhibition area. Incidentally, the world\'s most famous oceanographer, Jacques Cousteau, started his successful career here in 1933 when it was known as ‘Institute d\'Océanographique.’<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt’s well worth checking out the institute to get an insight into the richness of southern Vietnam’s aquaculture. Vietnam is after all a maritime country with a coastline that stretches for more than 3,260km. The Bien Dong (East Sea) plays an important role in the development of the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe exploration for reasonable and sustainable exploitation of resources and protection of the environment in the Bien Dong is the main objective of the institute. The 23 aquarium tanks on the ground floors are home to a variety of live specimens – including some wonderful seahorses. Behind the main buildings, the exhibition area features nearly 70,000 dead specimens and a rather spectacular giant whale’s skeleton.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The good doctor</strong></p>\r\n<p>Alexandre Yersin had a deep and meaningful relationship with Vietnam and the French doctor was in fact buried in Nha Trang on his request. Born in Switzerland, he came to Vietnam in 1889 after working under Louis Pasteur in Paris. He spoke Vietnamese fluently, and spent years travelling throughout the central highlands and recording his observations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring this period he discovered what is now Dalat and recommended to the colonical French government that a hill station be established there. Yersin also introduced rubber and quinine-producing trees to Vietnam. Today, the Pasteur Institute in Nha Trang coordinates vaccination and hygiene programmes for the country’s southern coastal region.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe doctor’s library and office were transformed into the Alexandre Yersin Museum, another one of the town’s cultural attractions. Items on display include laboratory equipment (such as his astronomical instruments), books from his library, a fascinating 3-D photo viewer and some of the thousand or so letters written to his mother. A model boat on display was apparently given to him by local fishermen with whom he spent a great deal of his time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo doubt Dr Yersin also liked the feel of the sand between his toes and the sea breeze blowing through his hair – and after a day of sight-seeing, the sun has gone down far enough for me to hit the beach, too.</p></p>', 0, '2010-12-26 10:24:24', '2010-12-26 10:24:24'),

These are the things that will attract foreign visitors most, and if properly developed, will undoubtedly create many job opportunities for the local people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are two forms of business in RT. One is on the environmental aspect (recycling rubbish, developing systems to save energy, electricity and water, instructing visitors to protect the environment and buy \"environmentally-friendly\" products). The other is on the socio-economic aspect (recruiting and providing training for needy locals, issuing policies on food and goods purchased by visitors, involving local people in guiding services, carrying and transporting).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr. Le Hoang Viet, from the Energy Conservation Research and Development Centre mentioned, \"If hotel businesses can pay more attention to energy-saving matters in areas such as the hotel lobby, rooms, kitchen, restaurants, washing and ironing services, entertainment and massage services, a huge amount of costs will be saved.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne example that has proved to be practical is the \"Company doing business with needy people\" model at Huyen Tran Culture Centre (Hue City). This model has created job opportunities for about 70 needy people. Among those 50 were trained as service staff (guides, security, cleaning and gardening staff), 15 trained to perform handicraft arts (making Vietnamese hats, frankincense and wooden items), and 5 trained to write calligraphy and practice meditation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe model has had a direct impact on generating income for the local labour force, and increasing income (at least by 15%) for about 500 handicraft production households in the neighbouring areas (as main source of supply for the Culture Centre). This will ensure the recovery and conservation of these traditional villages as well as tourism products, thus stablising this new market. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Nepal, the project was a success with about 70 responsible tourism activities created. Thousands of needy people were employed and their income significantly improved as a result.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Vietnam, the homestay tourism service model has been tested and applied in Sapa (Lao Cai), Cu Lao Cham (Quang Nam), Phuoc Tich Village (Hue), and Chay Lap Hamlet (Quang Binh). Eco-tourism has been used in Ha Long Bay (Quang Ninh), Can Gio Mangrove Forest (HCMC), and Tra Que Vegetable Village (Hoi An). This movement has opened up numerous positive directions for both businesses and local people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter surveying 5 main tourism locations in Vietnam, (Hanoi, HCMC, Hoi An, Ha Long and Hue), Mr. Phil Harman, Senior Advisor of the Netherlands Development Organisation (SNV) in Vietnam said, \"Visitors are now becoming more aware and concerned about other matters relating to tourism such as littering rubbish in public places, water and noise pollution. 97 percent of tourists, when interviewed, said that they were willing to pay more for a responsible travel holiday that is environmentally conscious and brings about more benefits for needy local people. Specifically, international and Vietnamese tourists will contribute respectively USD 47 and USD 27 more for each trip if RT service is included in the tour.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA great tip in RT: local people\'s friendliness is highly valued among tourists. In the survey done by the SNV, Hanoi is the place that visitors are the most displeased with.

Tôi có tin tức mới, cụ thể là về \"Tình hình thiết kế Đặc Vụ\". Hồi 3, phần III sắp bắt đầu, và chúng tôi biết theo thường lệ thì các bạn đang mong đợi sẽ có các Đặc Vụ ra mắt cùng thời điểm bắt đầu phần mới.\r\n\r\nTôi xin thay mặt đội ngũ sáng tạo nhân vật thông báo với các bạn rằng, Đặc Vụ mới của chúng ta, “———”, sẽ trình làng cùng bản cập nhật 3.10 - tức 2 tuần sau khi Hồi 3, Phần III bắt đầu.\r\n\r\nTrong quá trình phát triển Đặc Vụ mới, chúng tôi nhận thấy các nhân vật này chưa đạt chất lượng tốt nhất như điều các bạn mong đợi ở chúng tôi. Vì vậy chúng tôi quyết định trì hoãn lần ra mắt Đặc Vụ mới thêm 2 tuần để tranh thủ hoàn thiện thêm một số công đoạn cuối cùng. Đôi lúc 10% công việc sau cùng sẽ mang lại quả ngọt cho 90% thời lượng công việc trước đó.\r\n\r\nLo lắng của chúng tôi chủ yếu nằm ở phần lối chơi, chẳng hạn như tín hiệu trực quan về hành động hiện tại của Đặc Vụ vẫn chưa thật sự rõ ràng. Với một trò chơi mà các quyết định được đưa ra chỉ trong vài tích tắc như VALORANT thì đây là điều khó chấp nhận. Rõ ràng đây là một quyết định rất khó khăn, và chúng tôi mong các bạn sẽ thông cảm chờ đợi chúng tôi hoàn thiện nốt những chi tiết cuối cùng.\r\n\r\nGiờ đến tin tốt này! Chúng tôi vẫn rất hào hứng muốn chia sẻ với các bạn về Đặc Vụ kế tiếp. Đừng quên theo dõi các kênh mạng xã hội của chúng tôi vào lúc 10h tối ngày mai, 29/10 để cập nhật thông tin về đặc vụ hộ vệ sắp trình làng nhé.\r\n\r\n', 0, '2010-12-26 10:23:23', '2010-12-26 10:23:23');
